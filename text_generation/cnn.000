Separated by the entire North American continent and half the Pacific Ocean, the incoming and outgoing presidents are trading barbs -- both veiled and overt -- from their respective holiday vacations, souring a once a collegial public relationship. Marked by insults on Twitter, perceived public slights and foreign policy disputes, the ties between President-elect Donald Trump and President Barack Obama have significantly frayed less than a month before Trump is sworn into office. Both sides say the actual mechanics of transferring power from one administration to another are proceeding smoothly. The President-elect said he spoke with Obama Wednesday in what he termed a "nice conversation." And Trump's spokesman said Wednesday he expected more conversations between the two men before Inauguration Day on January 20. Trump, however, has become more open in his criticism of the President since he won last month, arguing on Twitter that Obama misjudged the election and lost badly. He scaled up his disparagement on Wednesday, writing that "inflammatory" statements from Obama were hampering a smooth transition. Obama has also offered criticism of his successor, albeit more tacitly. During a historic speech Tuesday in Pearl Harbor alongside Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Obama cautioned against tribalism and isolationism -- warnings that, during the campaign, he used to argue against Trump's candidacy. The latest back-and-forth comes after two weeks of open sparring between the White House and Trump's transition team over Russia and Israel. Once contained to sniping between aides, the squabbles have escalated to Obama and Trump themselves. The result is an openly antagonistic relationship between the commander in chief and the man who's about to replace him, a dynamic that both men explicitly worked to avoid in the days immediately following the election. In public, both Obama and Trump had been careful to avoid direct personal criticism of one another in the weeks following November's vote. White House officials said Obama's instructions were to maintain a professional and helpful tone, hoping to provide Americans reassurance in the peaceful hand-off of power. Trump, too, offered conciliatory signals. He was effusive during his first meeting with Obama in the Oval Office, the bitterness of the campaign and any remnants of his "birther" conspiracy vanished. Later, Trump revealed he was speaking regularly with Obama, describing a "warm" relationship fostering discussions about potential Cabinet picks. Obama had hoped his counsel might convince Trump to maintain some of his administration's work on climate change, health care and foreign policy. He regarded Trump as a largely non-ideological pragmatist who might be open to his guidance. A more combative tone eventually emerged, though Obama and Trump both sought to keep tensions at a minimum. Even Trump, known for his bombast, attempted to model the Obamas' "when they go low, we go high" mantra, praising the President at rallies even as his crowd booed. The President-elect sought to brush off a tiff with First Lady Michelle Obama, saying she misspoke when she told Oprah Winfrey that "we are feeling what not having hope feels like." Obama, too, attempted to ratchet down tensions surrounding Trump's dismissal of US intelligence blaming Russia for a cyberintrusion in the election. After a week in which his press secretary hammered Trump's operation for questioning the finding, Obama sought to cool the temperature, saying in his year-end news conference the matter shouldn't be caught up in politics. But disagreements over Israel this week and a suggestion from Obama he could have won in a contest with Trump seem to have ended the politesse. "I could've mobilized a majority of the American people to rally behind" a hope-and-change message, Obama told his senior adviser David Axelrod for The Axe Files podcast interview released Monday. It wasn't long before Trump began tweeting in an progressively more irksome tone: "President Obama said that he thinks he would have won against me. He should say that but I say NO WAY! - jobs leaving, ISIS, OCare, etc," he wrote on Monday. A day later: "President Obama campaigned hard (and personally) in the very important swing states, and lost. The voters wanted to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!" After Obama's Tuesday appearance in Hawaii warning against "the tug of tribalism" and "the urge to demonize those who are different," Trump's language on Wednesday morning was more direct. "Doing my best to disregard the many inflammatory President O statements and roadblocks," he wrote. "Thought it was going to be a smooth transition - NOT!" The White House declined to comment on Trump's accusation. Trump's incoming White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, downplayed any trouble. "The current President and his team have been very helpful and generous with their time," he said. But he didn't temper the acrimonious messages directed toward Obama and the transition. "With respect to the tweets, they speak for themselves, I think very clearly," Spicer said. "With respect to the tweets, they speak for themselves, I think very clearly," Spicer said. ©Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar said Thursday "getting on with our lives" means taking Russia's interference with the 2016 election seriously. The Obama administration is preparing to announce a series of retaliation measures against Russia for meddling in the US election, US officials said Wednesday. But President-elect Donald Trump appeared to brush off one-time rival Sen. Lindsey Graham's desire to impose sanctions on Russia following intelligence about Russian President Vladimir Putin's interference with the 2016 elections. "I don't know what he's doing. I haven't spoken to Sen. Graham," Trump told journalists Wednesday. "I think we ought to get on with our lives." But Klobuchar said moving forward is showing a commitment to freedom and disappointment with Russia. The Minnesota senator who backed Hillary Clinton said not responding to Russia could allow the meddling to continue. "Getting on with our lives means a life based on freedom, freedom of expression, freedom of democracy and not being influenced by foreign powers and hackers," she told CNN's Kate Bolduan Thursday on "At This Hour." Klobuchar praised Republican and Democratic lawmakers looking into ways to retaliate against Russia for allegedly violating the American electoral process. "I am hopeful that when the President-elect gets into office, he will take this very seriously. He must," she said. "That office is bigger than anyone that serves in that office and our government is based on this fundamental principle of democracy." Russian officials said if the US acts with hostility, they will respond. "If Washington really does take new hostile steps, they will be answered," Maria Zakharova, official representative for Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said in a statement Wednesday. "Any action against Russian diplomatic missions in the US will immediately bounce back on US diplomats in Russia."

But for all his social media prowess, the 70-year-old incoming president remains skeptical of emails, the Internet and, ultimately, "the whole ... age of computer." "I think the computers have complicated lives very greatly. The whole, you know, age of computer has made it where nobody knows exactly what's going on. We have speed and we have a lot of other things, but I'm not sure you have the kind of security you need," Trump told reporters Thursday evening. While widespread Internet and email use has made Americans more vulnerable to problems like hacking and identity theft, Trump's view of computers doesn't seem to jibe with that of most Americans. Nearly three-quarters of American adults own a desktop or laptop computer and 92% of Internet users use email, according to the Pew Research Center. Trump's soon-to-be predecessor, President Barack Obama, uses laptop computers and owns an iPad, on which he sometimes receives the President's Daily Brief of classified information. But Trump's skepticism of computers isn't just a matter of connecting with Americans. Trump will come into office at a time when the US faces intense cybersecurity challenges, from radicalization of US citizens online to a slew of recent hacks orchestrated by the Chinese and Russian governments. Asked about whether he favors sanctioning Russia for meddling in the US presidential election by hacking Democratic Party groups and individuals -- as confirmed by the US intelligence community -- Trump demurred: "I think we ought to get on with our lives." The President-elect has continued to resist the Intelligence Community's findings regarding Russian hacking, continuing to cast doubt in recent weeks as to whether Russia was truly behind the hack that the CIA, Director of National Intelligence and FBI all agree was aimed at bolstering Trump in the 2016 campaign. Trump's public distrust of those conclusions may have grown out of his concern for protecting the power of his electoral mandate, but his general skepticism about computers and email is not new. "I don't do the email thing," Trump said in a sworn deposition in 2007, His secretary sometimes sent emails on his behalf, but he did not. Nor did he own a personal home or office computer. In a 2013 deposition, Trump said he used email only "very rarely." And on the campaign trail, Trump sometimes explained his dislike for, and even distrust for, email in the context of bashing former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for her use of a private email server and the DNC hack, which boosted his campaign. "I'm not an email person," Trump said during a July press conference in which he invited Russia to uncover and release Clinton's deleted emails. "I don't believe in it because I think it can be hacked, for one thing. But when I send an email -- if I send one -- I send one almost never. I'm just not a believer in email." Similarly, just 29% of American adults are somewhat or very confident their email records are private and secure -- though it doesn't keep most from using email nonetheless. But Trump's distrust of emails doesn't just stem from a fear he could be hacked. It's also a way he's sought to shield himself from lawsuits. "I go to court and they say produce your emails. I say I don't have any emails. The judges don't even believe it," Trump said at a Tampa, Florida, rally in February at which he explained that he's "not a big believer in emails." "After you win the case, they say, 'Now I know that you're really smart.'" And in Still, Trump has not eschewed technology altogether. The candidate shot to political relevance by opining on a range of current events and pop culture topics via Twitter long before he launched his run for president. And during the campaign, Trump masterfully used the social media platform to drive the campaign narrative, needling and insulting political rivals and pushing back on damaging news stories with a series of 140-character tweets. The President-elect owns a Samsung Galaxy smartphone, which he uses primarily to make phone calls and blast out his late-night tweets when no one is around for him to dictate them to. But unlike a growing number of Americans, Trump doesn't get his news online. The billionaire's daily routine has long begun by reading print newspapers -- usually The New York Times and New York Post -- and watching TV news shows, rather than reading articles online. Just 2 in 10 Americans typically get their news from print newspapers while 38% get their news online, according to News articles from online publications still reach him, after a member of his staff has printed them off. That's prompted several reporters to receive printouts of their articles scrawled with Trump's handwriting delivering a critique of the story.

"You all know Don King? Who doesn't know Don King," the President-elect asked reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida. "It's just great to be an American. And now with our leader, we're gonna ... make America great again," King replied. King, a longtime friend of Trump's, praised the former reality television star's journey to the White House. "You have to admit he shocked the world," King said. Trump has repeatedly accused the Obama administration of not being a strong enough ally of Israel. King was waving an Israeli flag while he spoke with reporters and said it was a symbol of peace. "We want everyone to come together as one unit who can make things happen," King said. "He's a leader that can make things happen." Often frustrated with President Barack Obama, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday he looks forward to Trump's arrival in the White House in his response to Secretary of State John Kerry's speech criticizing Israeli settlements on the West Bank. King campaigned for Trump throughout the presidential campaign, arguing that he was the best candidate for black and female voters, two groups that overwhelmingly supported the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton. "This is an election about the people and the candidates -- who's the strongest, the bravest, the most courageous. To take them out of that, there is none other than a guy named Donald J.

Trump," King ©As they each luxuriate on islands at the left and right edges of the country, President Barack Obama and his successor, Donald Trump, are finding they have decidedly different ideas of a good time. The outgoing President prefers early mornings at the gym and late nights in upscale Asian bistros. The incoming one remains closer to home, partial to a wedge salad named for himself eaten in the Italianate splendor of his own private club. While Obama seeks to put as much distance as he can -- physically and mentally -- between himself and Washington, Trump tracks political news by the minute, tweeting terse responses from his southern outpost. In Hawaii, Obama favors the company of friends he's known long enough they don't call him "Mr. President." For Trump, the designation can't come soon enough: the nameplate at his Christmas dinner place setting bore his soon-to-be title. Settling into a second week of vacation, both the President and the President-elect have surrounded themselves with family and friends in palm-shaded paradise. But there's little similarity in what each is seeking from his island getaway. Holidays in Hawaii have always marked an escape for Obama from the White House to the life and people he knew before he became famous. Mar-a-Lago, where Trump has holed up, is less a nostalgic reminder of a simpler time and more a testament to the lifestyle his notoriety affords. Trump has emerged only briefly from his fortified Florida compound since he arrived, once to play golf with Tiger Woods and again to attend Christmas Eve church services. Obama, meanwhile, has played four rounds of golf in Hawaii, each with the same group of high school friends he's known for decades. "My best friends from high school don't operate any differently with me now than they did when I was (younger)," Obama told his former adviser and CNN commentator David Axelrod in an interview for his CNN podcast. "One gift I do seem to have is getting really, really good friends around me who've got my back. And that gives you a certain serenity in the midst of a lot of foolishness." In Palm Beach, where Trump has decamped, the foolishness doesn't seem quite as far away. While he's been here, the President-elect has maintained a steady stream of tweets about the UN Security Council's vote on Israel and other political matters. A message posted on Monday about Obama's interview with Axelrod suggested the televisions at Mar-a-Lago are still tuned to cable news, where the story got heavy play. Like Obama, Trump surrounds himself with friends. But instead of pals from childhood, his circle consists of Palm Beach's wealthy denizens, many of whom pay steeply to join his private club. Those friends say that's where Trump feels most himself, encircled by a rotating assortment of children, grandchildren and members. "He's surrounded by people he likes and knows and trusts, and he's in a different bubble," said Robin Bernstein, one of Mar-a-Lago's original members who said she has spoken to Trump nearly every day of his presidential vacation this month. "Most of the people in and around the clubs are people who have known him for years." "He seems relaxed and happy, joking, playing golf," Bernstein said. "He just seems genuinely happy to be in a place where he feels comfortable." For Trump, that hasn't meant an escape from work. On Tuesday, he resumed high-level staff meetings to plan his new administration. He's also set to interview candidates for remaining Cabinet posts, including the Agriculture and Veterans Affairs secretaries. While the White House says Obama receives his classified intelligence briefing every day in Hawaii, there's little by way of work unless something drastic happens somewhere in the world (and usually, something does). Obama met with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe Tuesday and toured Pearl Harbor, but previous displays of vacation diplomacy have been rare. This year, Obama added a new activity to his normal routine of golf, hiking, shaved ice and dining out: a "breakout" strategy simulation game with his daughters and their friends. He's never stopped by any of his boyhood homes, most of which offer few hints at their famous former resident, or the Punahou School, where he famously established the "choom gang" of pot enthusiasts during his teenage years. Oahu, like Obama, has grown richer since those days. At night, the President and first lady are often spotted in the island's ritziest dining rooms: Nobu, Morimoto, and Alan Wong's. On that front, Honolulu and Palm Beach can feel similar. Both have tony shopping streets, although they cater to vastly different clienteles. The designer boutiques in Waikiki sprang up as a destination for the tens of thousands of Japanese tourists who visit yearly; in Palm Beach, the shops along Worth Avenue were built as a draw for the old-money families who have wintered here for a century. It's the Worth Avenue set that Trump has been welcoming to Mar-a-Lago since he acquired the historic property in 1985. Due-paying members can still enjoy an up-close view of the incoming President, who still mingles and takes photo with guests. Life continues apace at the club, which costs $100,000 to join and offers a swimming pool, spa, a croquet green and bridge lessons. Members say that aside from the boosted security outside Mar-a-Lago's gates, the life of poolside lunches under canary-yellow cabanas is largely unchanged. On Christmas Eve, a long line of Jaguars, Maseratis and Mercedes-Benz snaked down South Ocean Boulevard, waiting to be sniffed by a dog and scanned by Secret Service officers before entering the gated compound. The club hosted the same massive holiday dinners for members as in years past, complete with Trump's Wedge Salad, Colossal Crab Cocktail and traditional turkey dinner on the menu. This year, guests looking for a handshake with the owner faced a retinue of Secret Service a step away. Trump's friends say they provide another type of protection, one meant to shield the billionaire from the onslaught of political arrows aimed his direction. "He can relax here," Bernstein said. "We're here to protect him as much as we can." "He can relax here," Bernstein said. "We're here to protect him as much as we can." ©President Barack Obama took unprecedented steps Thursday to retaliate against alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election, prompting vows from Russian authorities that Moscow will respond in kind. The administration described Russia's involvement as "Significant Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities" and sanctioned four Russian individuals and five Russian entities for what it said was election interference. The administration also ordered 35 Russian diplomats to leave the country and two Russian compounds are being closed. This is the first time the names of Russian officials involved in the hacking have become public on the sanctions list. "Russia's cyberactivities were intended to influence the election, erode faith in US democratic institutions, sow doubt about the integrity of our electoral process, and undermine confidence in the institutions of the US government," a White House statement said. "These actions are unacceptable and will not be tolerated." According to statements from the White House and the Treasury Department, the government has sanctioned nine entities and individuals over their alleged interference in the election: the GRU and the FSB, which are two Russian intelligence services; four individual officers of the GRU; and three companies that provided material support to the GRU's operations. The US also separately sanctioned two Russian individuals, Obama also said in the statement announcing that the diplomats have been ordered to leave the country and that those individuals and their families were given 72 hours to leave the United States. "These actions follow repeated private and public warnings that we have issued to the Russian government, and are a necessary and appropriate response to efforts to harm US interests in violation of established international norms of behavior," Obama said in the statement. President-elect Donald Trump -- who has publicly expressed skepticism that Russia meddled in the election -- said Thursday it's time for the US to "move on" regarding the hacking. But he added that he would meet with intelligence officials next week to be briefed on the matter. "It's time for our country to move on to bigger and better things," Trump said in a statement. "Nevertheless, in the interest of our country and its great people, I will meet with leaders of the intelligence community next week in order to be updated on the facts of this situation." A senior Obama administration official acknowledged to reporters Thursday that Trump could reverse the sanctions by executive order, but added, "I don't think it'd make a lot of sense." The Russian diplomats and the two compounds, located in Maryland and New York, were engaged in intelligence activities but were not alleged to have been involved in the hacking related to the election, White House Homeland Security adviser Lisa Monaco told reporters. The moves are instead part of the US's comprehensive reaction to election-related hacking as well as recent harassment of US personnel in Russia. "What these individuals were doing were basically collecting intelligence. They were intelligence officers operating here and using these compounds, one in New York, one in Maryland, for intelligence collection purposes," Monaco told CNN's Jake Tapper on "The Lead" Thursday. "And what we are saying today is, in response to and in order to impose consequences for the Russian government's increasing harassment and aggression toward our personnel in Moscow, and, of course, their malicious cyberactivities, interfering and an effort to interfere in our election process, we are imposing consequences." Russia swiftly responded to the actions Thursday. Russia will respond to any "hostile steps" that the US may take in response to allegations of hacking during the 2016 election, according to the Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said similar steps will be taken in response to the expulsions, though she did not immediately provide further details. Dmitri Peskov, a spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin, told reporters there is "no alternative to reciprocal measures," adding that Putin is "in no rush to make a decision." Russia's first visible action came later Thursday, when Russian authorities ordered the closure of the Anglo-American School of Moscow, a US official briefed on the matter said. The order from the Russian government closes the school, which serves children of US, British and Canadian embassy personnel, to US and foreign nationals. The order also closes access to the US embassy vacation house in Serebryany Bor, near Moscow. Soon after the administration's announcement, Russia's embassy in the UK House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican, called the sanctions "overdue," adding that it is an "appropriate way to end eight years of failed policy with Russia." "Russia does not share America's interests," he said in a statement Thursday. "In fact, it has consistently sought to undermine them, sowing dangerous instability around the world. While today's action by the administration is overdue, it is an appropriate way to end eight years of failed policy with Russia. And it serves as a prime example of this administration's ineffective foreign policy that has left America weaker in the eyes of the world." Republican Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham, two of Russia's fiercest critics in the US Senate, called for stronger sanctions against Russia. "The retaliatory measures announced by the Obama administration today are long overdue. But ultimately, they are a small price for Russia to pay for its brazen attack on American democracy. We intend to lead the effort in the new Congress to impose stronger sanctions on Russia," the two said in a joint statement. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper issued a statement on Thursday reiterating the agency's confidence that the Russian government was involved in the US hacking. "This activity by Russian intelligence services is part of a decade-long campaign of cyber-enabled operations directed at the US Government and its citizens," the statement read. "The US Government can confirm that the Russian government, including Russia's civilian and military intelligence services, conducted many of the activities generally described by a number of these security companies." The administration's announcement comes after months of internal debate over how to respond to Russian hacking that US law enforcement and intelligence agencies have watched take place for over a year. The US government announced in October that it was "confident" that the Russian government orchestrated the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and other political organizations of the Democratic Party to influence the 2016 election. The hacking of DNC emails eventually led to the resignation of former chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz after emails showed her favoring Clinton over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders during the Democratic primary. ©Donald Trump is not afraid of litigation. During the presidential campaign alone, he threatened to sue sexual assault None of these disputes ever materialized into an actual lawsuit -- at least not yet -- but Trump has several pending cases sitting on dockets in federal and state courts across the country as he prepares to be sworn in as the 45th President of the United States on January 20. Trump recently ended his dispute with certain But several remaining lawsuits do not appear anywhere close to resolution -- leaving the soon-to-be-president not only exposed to potential financial liability, but facing a deposition or even trial once in office. Here's a rundown of some of the more interesting cases: Jose Andres and Geoffrey Zakarian pulled out of agreements to open restaurants in Trump's Washington hotel following Trump's 2015 reference to some Mexican immigrants as "rapists." Trump sued the chefs for breach of contract, seeking over $10 million in damages apiece, and they countersued. Trump was deposed in the Zakarian suit and is now slated to be deposed the first During the campaign, Trump referred to his rallies as the "safest place on Earth," but he faces a number of active lawsuits from those who claim to have experienced threats or violence at the hands of his security and campaign teams. In March, three protestors claimed they were called derogatory names, shoved and punched at a rally in Louisville, Kentucky, after Trump directed the audience to "get 'em out of here." The plaintiffs have filed a complaint against Trump and two of his supporters, Trump's attorneys have filed a motion to dismiss the case, but the judge has yet to rule. Plaintiffs' attorney Greg Belzley told CNN that if the judge denies Trump's motion to dismiss, he will seek to depose the incoming president. In a separate lawsuit, two men in Alabama sued the Trump campaign, several of his security personnel and the Birmingham Jefferson Convention Center, alleging in the complaint that they were "assaulted and beaten by an angry mob that had been incited by Donald J. Trump" at a rally in Birmingham. In September, five Mexican human rights activists filed suit against Trump, his campaign and his chief of security, Keith Schiller, among others. The plaintiffs allege that Trump security officials, namely Schiller, assaulted them as they protested outside of Trump Tower in New York. Trump has not been deposed in the case and no trial date has been set. Finally, a former Trump campaign staffer claims that Trump's North Carolina State Director pulled a gun on him, and the campaign did nothing about it after the staffer reported the incident. Described in the complaint as a "passionate" Trump supporter, Vincent Bordini sued the Trump campaign and Earl Phillip, the state director, in August, asserting several causes of action, including battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and negligent supervision. A trial date has been set for July and the parties remain in discovery. Trump currently faces multiple suits related to his golf clubs. One dates back to 2013 in which members of the Jupiter Golf Club claim they were stripped of their refundable deposits after Trump's company acquired The Ritz-Carlton Golf Club & Spa Jupiter in Florida and changed the terms of membership. Both Donald and Eric Trump were deposed in the matter, it went to trial before a judge in August, and the parties are awaiting a ruling. In an unrelated case, a woman filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against Jupiter in June, alleging she endured persistent unwelcome advances from the Food and Beverage Director of the club, and was then retaliated against for reporting him. The parties have submitted a joint scheduling order proposing a December 2017 trial date in that matter. Then there is the case of a former maintenance worker at the Trump National Golf Club in New Jersey who claimed he faced intense harassment after coming out to his co-workers as gay, including having golf balls and rocks "routinely" thrown at him, according to court papers. The soon-to-be First Lady has not shied away from lawsuits herself. Last fall, Melania Trump threatened to sue People magazine for an article accusing her husband of forcing himself on a reporter. Then in September, she sued the Daily Mail for defamatory statements about her supposedly having been an "escort" in the 1990s. The paper printed a retraction, but the lawsuit appears to be moving full steam ahead, with Melania Trump seeking $150 million in damages and even making an in-person appearance at a routine court hearing earlier this month. The next status conference in the case is scheduled for January 27 -- just one week after Donald Trump's inauguration.

"He wants to write the inaugural himself," said presidential historian Douglas Brinkley, who met with Trump Wednesday to discuss, among other things, the upcoming speech on January 20th. Trump was expected to spend at least part of his day Thursday at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, working on the speech, according to officials. "He doesn't want it to be long," Brinkley said on CNN. "He would like it to be a shorter one. He doesn't want people standing out in the cold." Trump, who initially chafed at the rigid formality of delivering speeches from a Teleprompter, is mindful of the inaugural's role in setting the tone for his upcoming administration, officials say. Until now, his highest-profile speech came at this summer's Republican National Convention. That address was darker in tone, warning of a deteriorating society and touting his ability to fix the country's problems. Earlier this week, Trump's transition said the President-elect would rely on Stephen Miller, a policy aide who crafted his convention speech, to work on the inaugural address. Brinkley said Trump on Wednesday was intent on drafting the entirety of the speech himself, with input from his team. Presidents and Presidents-elect typically work jointly with speechwriters to piece together major sets of remarks. The topics are said to include the education system, infrastructure, border security, the state of the military, the economy and the outsourcing of jobs. Boris Epshteyn, a spokesman for Trump's inauguration committee, previewed a more optimistic address from Trump and Miller than what was delivered at this summer's convention. "They will be talking about uniting America, bringing American together. We are now in the post-politics, post-campaign season and that's the messaging around this inaugural," he told CNN on Tuesday. "I'm expecting a great address ... that talks to Americans about dreaming big, about making sure that we are a city on a hill one more time." Brinkley said Trump recognized the importance of the speech and, more importantly, recognized that it would be a major ratings draw. "You know, we've had high ratings for the debates," he said. "I think he's starting to get in the zone that we're looking at how this inaugural is going to be watched, and he's going to put a lot of effort into it." Past inaugural speeches have drawn millions of viewers, though fewer than watched this year's presidential debates between Trump and rival Hillary Clinton. In 2009, 37.7 million viewers tuned in for President Barack Obama's first inauguration. Four years later, 20.5 million people watched. Those numbers are dwarfed, however, by interest in this year's contest. In September, 84 million people tuned in to the first general election debate. As he was departing Mar-a-Lago Wednesday, Brinkley said Trump and he had discussed a few earlier inaugurals in a historical context, including Richard Nixon's, Ronald Reagan's and John F. Kennedy's. They also talked about William Henry Harrison, the President who was rumored to have caught a cold during a lengthy inauguration speech that turned into pneumonia (history shows he actually caught the cold a few weeks later). Brinkley said the history of Trump's position was plainly enlivening for the President-elect. "He told me he's excited to sleep in the Lincoln Bedroom on his first night," Brinkley said. "He told me he's excited to sleep in the Lincoln Bedroom on his first night," Brinkley said. ©From pundits and prognosticators to political party people and the principals themselves, no one could have predicted it.

Trump. ©With the finish line in view, President Barack Obama is entering a sprint. He's scaled up his executive power moves in a bid to solidify some of his legacy items before Donald Trump takes office. Many of his actions won't be easily reversed. Here's a look at what Obama's done since Election Day, and what he's expected to do in the coming weeks. This is the first time the names of Russian officials involved in the hacking have become public on the sanctions list. Obama also said in a separate statement that 35 Russian diplomats have been ordered to leave the country, and two Russian compounds are being closed under Thursday's actions. "I think we ought to get on with our lives. I think computers have complicated our lives very greatly. The whole age of computer has made it where nobody knows exactly what is going on. And we have speed and a lot of things and I'm not kind the security that you need. And I have not spoken with the senators and I will certainly will be over a period of time," Trump said. ©2016 was the year where one political controversy or another was always around the corner. But 2017 promises to be just as unpredictable. For most of 2016, Donald Trump had only his own personal credibility in his hands as he campaigned for the presidency. Now that he has the prize, his decisions and conduct will affect millions of Americans and the stability and prosperity of the entire world. Here are 17 issues, questions and trends that will shape politics when the age of Trump dawns in January. Will the new commander-in chief's unorthodox style shatter the ceremonial conventions of the top job in global politics? Or will the heavy responsibilities of office and the life-and-death decisions he will make every day temper his unrestrained style and scattershot way of making policy and settling scores on Twitter? The reality star will shortly become the President, commander-in-chief, head of state and the face of America abroad. For all the unprecedented antics and twists of the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump has never faced such an examination of knowledge, temperament and public scrutiny. Trump has promised to repair tortured US relations with Russia, raising expectations in Moscow and creating high stakes for his new relationship with President Vladimir Putin. There are expectations that US sanctions imposed after the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine could be lifted and the two sides will work together closely to combat ISIS in the Middle East. But both Trump's predecessors tried to reset relations with Russia, initiatives that foundered in no small part because of Putin's core political project of rebuilding Moscow's lost influence at the expense of Washington's power. Can Trump do any better? Nothing has animated the Republican Party over the last six-plus years more than a desire to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Now the Trump administration and the GOP on Capitol Hill have the chance. But they also have the responsibility for millions of people who receive health insurance under the program. How quickly the administration manages to provide a workable alternative and whether it can preserve popular aspects of the program will dictate the political price it will pay for such a huge policy lift. Trump, Vice President-elect Mike Pence and the picks for the top roles at the State Department and CIA lack recent experience at the very top levels of government dealing with a breaking national security crisis. Such a challenge could arise early on for instance, from North Korea's expanding ballistic missile and nuclear program or from a terror attack. The crisis will test Trump's unorthodox outsider approach to government and the quality of advice he gets from the national security team around him. Trump vowed on the campaign trail to pull out of the Paris climate deal. More recently, he has said he has an "open mind." Still, the nascent administration, in personnel picks and policy, is suggesting it will repeal Obama-era regulations designed to cut US emissions. Even if Trump does not initiate the complex process of pulling out of the deal, steps his White House takes could cause the slow erosion of the agreement if the US does not live up to its commitments. No political program is as important to Trump's conception of himself as a great builder than the infrastructure scheme he is proposing to revive the nation's transportation system, bridges, tunnels, electricity grid, clean water system and oil pipelines. Trump promises to tear down Obama-era regulations that he says have thwarted growth-boosting infrastructure projects. But conservatives have a long history of opposing Big Government interventions and doubt claims they reap jobs growth. This may be one area where Trump and congressional Democrats find common ground. Trump constructed his campaign on fury among grass roots Republicans over undocumented migrants. His promise to build a wall on the southern border and make Mexico pay for it took on huge symbolic importance. How Trump overcomes the political and practical challenges over the project will help shape his presidency. His moves on expelling undocumented migrants and plans for "extreme" vetting of visitors and immigrants from Muslim nations will define his legacy on the issue that helped his presidential bid catch fire. Trump has repeatedly mocked the Iran nuclear deal, the centerpiece of President Barack Obama's second term foreign policy, and vowed to renegotiate it and drive a harder bargain. Since the agreement was not submitted to a hostile Congress as a treaty, Trump has the executive power to halt implementation with the stroke of a pen. However, the pact also involves European allies that are unlikely to restore sanctions on Tehran. A decision to pull out of the deal could also lead Trump onto an unpredictable path that could eventually raise the possibility of military action. One factor that will be out of Trump's control in 2017 but will still influence the course of his presidency will be the Democrats. The party is reeling over its defeat in November and lacks a clear central philosophy, future direction or bench of talented 2020 presidential candidates. Chuck Schumer, the incoming Senate minority leader, will be a key player in organizing resistance to the Trump agenda and defending Obama's legacy. Whether Democrats can make Trump spend political capital to confirm his Cabinet and potential Supreme Court nominees and the implementation of his agenda will be crucial in the run-up to midterm elections in 2018. For now, the Republican Party cannot believe its luck with the President-elect. Trump has constructed a Cabinet of conservatives that could augur the movement's best chance to enshrine its ideas on tax, social and domestic issues since the Reagan administration. But after the first wave of reform, problems may emerge. It is not clear whether Trump is as willing to go as far as Capitol Hill Republicans on reforming entitlements like Medicare for instance. The dynamics of the checks and balances of the US political system are also likely, sooner-or-later, to draw the White House into conflict with GOP leaders in Congress. Trump has vowed to brand China a currency manipulator on day one, could impose trade tariffs on Chinese goods and threatened to put Beijing's most cherished red line -- Taiwan -- on the negotiating table. Is the new President really ready to unleash all out confrontation with America's rising superpower rival? The new President will inherit an economy that has spent the last eight years battling back from the brink of an averted second Great Depression. Unemployment is at 4.6 %, GDP growth was 3.5% in the third quarter. So the new president inherits a strong platform. His prescription for tax cuts that are likely to favor the rich and a purge against regulations have Republicans predicting a huge economic expansion. Yet Trump's warnings of punitive trade sanctions against China and vow to renegotiate deals like NAFTA could mean an unpredictable year ahead for the global economy. Trump must also find a way to live up to his promises of lifting blue collar voters who have lost jobs to the technological revolution and low wage economies abroad and who helped put him in the White House. Trump's election has caused deep disquiet in Europe and Asia because of his critiques of the US alliances that have been the bedrock of global stability since World War II. Trump has vowed to make allies in Europe and Asia to pay more for US protection. He sees the arrangements more as transactional business deals rather than the building blocks of US global power. Governments in both regions are currently struggling to work out exactly how Trump will approach them and what it means for their own security. Trump's desire to improve relations with Russia has also rattled some NATO powers, especially those formerly in the Warsaw Pact, who are deeply worried by Putin's revanchist territorial challenges. No President in modern times has taken office with such an intricate web of US and foreign business arrangements as Trump. He has yet to make good on his promise to hold a press conference to explain to the nation how he will avoid potential conflicts of interests. Even if Trump does completely step away from his company, he is under intense pressure to demonstrate that his presidency is his only concern after January 20. If he fails, this could be an issue that haunts his administration and defies Trump's ability to emerge from the most damaging controversies. Trump presented himself to voters as the only man able to drive a better deal for America in the world. He has vowed to stop nations like China acting in a way that he believes rips off the United States. He said his unique deal-making skills will restore what many Republicans believe is lost US power and prestige. He implied that complicated geopolitical equations that govern relations with nations like Iran, North Korea and Russia and the Middle East could be unlocked by his negotiating skills. At home, he's already taken to intervening directly with US companies like Carrier to save jobs and Boeing in a bid to trim the costs of defense procurement. When he is President, Trump's claims and credibility are on the line. Trump relishes having a foil and singled out the media as a politically profitable enemy during his campaign. There are already signs that his White House will tear up the way the presidency does business with the press. Journalists are already bracing for a contentious term with a president who calls them "dishonest" and obsessively critiques everything they do. The last decade has been one of extraordinary political turbulence in the US with voters handing both parties the White House and large congressional majorities in wave elections shaped by deep disillusionment with Washington and establishment politicians. Trump is the culmination of that trend and won the presidency by running as the ultimate outsider who will blow up discredited institutions and business as usual in the capital. How far Trump lives up to these expectations, and how voters respond will determine how national politics evolves -- not just in 2017 but in the years to come.

George Conway, a corporate attorney who is married to one of President-elect Donald Trump's senior advisers, is on the shortlist of candidates to be nominated as US solicitor general, two sources familiar with the process told CNN. Bloomberg News George Conway declined to comment, but one of the sources said he would accept the position should Trump tap him to be the government's top litigator. The other source said he has been interviewed by Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, Trump's attorney general-designate. The solicitor general is the Justice Department's third-highest ranking official and argues cases on the federal government's behalf at the US Supreme Court. Kellyanne Conway, meanwhile, was tapped earlier this month to become counselor to the president once Trump is inaugurated next month. George Conway is a partner at the corporate law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, where he has worked for 28 years. He is currently a partner in the firm's litigation department, where he has honed his talents in securities, contract and antitrust litigation, according to his firm's website. Throughout his career, he has represented high-profile clients, including the National Football League and cigarette giant Philip Morris, whom he represented in a successful defamation lawsuit against ABC News. Conway has already stood before the Supreme Court, arguing a case before it in 2010, Conway graduated from Yale Law School in 1987 after attending Harvard College.

Lee Zeldin said Friday. Earlier in the day, Putin said he would not expel American diplomats from Russia despite calls to do so from top Russian officials. Zeldin, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told CNN's Kate Bolduan on "OutFront" that the back and forth between the two countries is "like a complicated inside baseball game." "I do believe Putin is outsmarting President Obama with his response. He's been allowed to take the high road, be magnanimous. It's unfortunate. Now, we need to move forward," Zeldin said. However, Zeldin would not say that he supported President-elect Donald Trump's tweet praising Putin for delaying a response to the sanctions. "I am no fan of Vladimir Putin. I think he looks in the mirror and he aspires to be Vladimir the Great. He'd love to put the USSR back together again," Zeldin said. Zeldin said it "makes by far the most amount of sense" that Russia is responsible for the hacking, but that the intelligence report on the hacking does not answer all of his questions. He said the report was very brief and "used large font and big pictures with a lot of holes in it." The congressman said he is hoping Obama can answer all of his questions when he provides members of Congress with additional intelligence on the hacking. Trump should keep the new sanctions imposed by Obama "if he can use these sanctions, leverage it as part of a bigger plan that we are moving in the right direction and we are realigning things around the map back to the way they are supposed to be," Zeldin said. "But again, this needs to be part of a larger plan and not one step at a time," he added. "But again, this needs to be part of a larger plan and not one step at a time," he added. ©Sen. John McCain said Friday that Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 presidential election amounted to an "act of war." The Arizona Republican, who is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, also has scheduled a hearing for next week on foreign cyberthreats to the US, which will also focus on Russian cyberhacking, a committee aide told CNN earlier Friday. McCain, who is one of Washington's most prominent foreign policy hardliners, has criticized the recent sanctions and expulsions announced by the Obama administration this week as insufficient and belated. He made his latest comments in Ukraine, a nation threatened by a resurgent Russia, after meeting with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. "When you attack a country, it's an act of war," McCain said of the recent hackings on Ukrainian TV, according to a transcript compiled by Reuters. "And so we have to make sure that there is a price to pay so that we can perhaps persuade Russians to stop this kind of attacks on our very fundamentals of democracy." McCain has invited James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, Admiral Mike Rogers, Director of the National Security Agency, and Marcel Lettre, the Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence, to next week's hearing, according to the aide. Politico President-elect Donald Trump is scheduled to meet for the first time next week with top leaders of the Intelligence agencies. The President-elect has said it's time to "move on," but McCain and other top Hill leaders have vowed to press legislation next year on sanctions in addition to the those announced by President Barack Obama this week. Obama took unprecedented steps Thursday to retaliate against Russian interference in the 2016 election, including expelling 35 Russian operatives from the United States. Those moves came after what the intelligence community says were Russian-orchestrated hackings of Democratic Party organizations during the election. Putin said Friday that the Kremlin would not retaliate and make similar expulsions.

But even as President Vladimir Putin So what comes next and who holds the advantage? Here's what we know, what the players are saying -- and how the chess match is unfolding. After weeks of ramped-up accusations about Russian hacking and promises of retaliation, The new sanctions follow months of insinuations, leaks and, more recently, open accusations that Moscow set out on a coordinated campaign to hack the private communications of American political actors, making public information that would both undermine voters' confidence in the November elections and, according to some, boost Trump's campaign. In a "joint analysis report" by the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI, released with the sanctions notice on Thursday a summary titled " The Russian President's In retrospect, Moscow's tactics appeared orchestrated: first threatening to match the explosions announced by the Obama administration the previous day, then, in seeking to appear magnanimous -- even extending an invitation to the children of American diplomats in Washington to a Christmas party at the Kremlin -- backing off. At the same time, Putin laid the onus of action on incoming President Donald Trump. "It's a smart play," said James Nixie, head of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the London-based think-tank Chatham House. He said that while "Russia feels humiliated -- it has been exposed and it has been punished," Putin can afford to wait a few weeks to hit back. "He's thought about it, considered acting now, but in fact is just being patient," Nixie said. Putin's decision will force Trump to show his hand -- and fast. "If Trump doesn't play ball, then we'll be back to the old-style adversarial relations," Nixie said. Putin is waiting to see "is Trump on our side, or is he not? At this point, we don't know, either." On Friday afternoon, the President-elect offered some blunt instruction. "Great move on delay (by V. Putin)," he tweeted. "I always knew he was very smart!" While there are echoes of the Cold War in the matching expulsion threats, Nixie argued that Russia's actions are predominantly about its future, not its past: Moscow "wants a new set of rules" to govern the way the world is run -- who wields the power, who controls what, and who listens to whom. Putin's move can also be read as an "enormous insult" to the Obama administration, said Jill Dougherty, a Russia analyst and former Moscow bureau chief for CNN. "It's an amazing move and it's classic Putin," she said. "He's a master of doing things that are unexpected, and this is truly unexpected." That depends on whom you ask. Trump has for months routinely questioned government assertions that state-sponsored Russian hackers were behind the breaches at the Democratic National Committee and inside Clinton's campaign. He has suggested the Chinese could be to blame, or even "somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds." But the US government has been laser-focused on Moscow for months. In October, officials publicly announced they were "confident" Russia had targeted the Democratic Party and aligned organizations. Obama this summer allowed, but How the unflattering communications put on display by the hacks affected the election is nearly impossible to quantify, but the slow drip seemed calculated to sow discord and doubt, especially among Democrats during and after a tense primary contest. Trump now says he'll meet with the intelligence community to hear their case. The ultimate decision followed a CIA announcement this month, made in private to a group of top US senators, that Their evidence -- which, again, has not been made public except through leaks to the press -- includes findings that Russian hackers breached, but did not make public information stolen from the accounts of Republicans, including House members and GOP non-profits, according to a former senior law enforcement official with direct knowledge of the hack investigation told CNN. The Republican National Committee has denied reports that it was compromised or targeted, and earlier this month, Trump's incoming press secretary, Sean Spicer, questioned the intelligence community's motives. "If they are so certain it happened, why won't they go on the record and say it?" Spicer The Russians tend to get the credit -- and criticism -- for being crafty or acting covertly to advance a range of interests. On its face, the new round of sanctions are a simple act of retaliation -- less a deft or devious hand than a symbolic swat -- for the Kremlin's alleged role in the election season hacks. But whether it was intended or not, the Obama administration's decision to act now, less than a month before clearing out ahead of Trump's inaugural, will have a series of knock-on effects that should create difficulties and set a series of political traps for the new administration. Trump has made no secret of his hopes to establish better relations with Putin and his autocratic regime. He played down news of the sanctions on Thursday, saying it was "time for the country to move on to bigger and better things." A day earlier, the President-elect seemed to throw up his hands entirely, pleading ignorance -- " Trump will need a more comprehensive argument, and understanding, if he is going to successfully navigate a Congress almost uniformly in favor of maintaining or, in the case of hawks like Sens. Lindsey Graham and John McCain, pursuing further avenues of redress. If Obama, his legislative legacy under threat from all corners, can effectively tie up the new administration and members of its own party -- to say nothing of Democrats who will gladly align themselves with more mainstream Republicans -- then he stands a better chance of at least complicating Trump's efforts to undo the work of the past eight years. Trump, who has repeatedly said he just wants everyone to move on, can undo the Thursday sanctions with relative ease after he takes office on January 20. But a unilateral decision to reverse course could expose divisions in a GOP caucus that, for all its post-election talk of unity, remains fundamentally divided on key issues like spending and what to do after it repeals Obamacare. The confluence of Obama's action and Putin's demurral will test Trump right from the jump, as moving for steadier relations with Moscow will now come at a heightened domestic cost. House Speaker Paul Ryan, a Russia critic, will likely seek to influence Trump, further stressing their already fragile relationship and challenging incoming chief of staff Reince Priebus, who has emerged as a trusted middleman between his idiosyncratic boss and the established GOP order. While the GOP establishment has stayed critical of Russia, Trump sees it differently. He is also threatened by his unique handicap -- an apparent inability to, at least publicly, conceive of the hacking story as anything more or less than a backdoor assault on the legitimacy of his victory on Election Day. "If Russia, or some other entity, was hacking, why did the White House wait so long to act?" he asked The claim was demonstrably false -- the grousing had begun well before November 8 -- but made clear how Trump perceives the question. In his Thursday statement, the President-elect was more reserved and revealed he would, "in the interest of our country and its great people," take a meeting with "leaders of the intelligence community next week in order to be updated on the facts of this situation." How Trump responds to those facts, and whether he accepts them at all, will go a long way in articulating the paths ahead. But until those options are clear, his likeliest route is anyone's guess.

The Obama administration's expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats Thursday, a response to Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 election, is only the latest attempt by both US and Russian authorities to remove foreign operatives from their nations. Russian President Vladimir Putin, himself a former KGB intelligence officer, has placed agents into US society. In June 2010, FBI cameras captured Russian agent Anna Chapman and a federal undercover agent meeting in New York for coffee. Seventeen days later, Chapman and nine other alleged Russian sleeper agents were arrested in New York, New Jersey and Virginia, charged with conspiracy to act as unlawful agents of Russia. The spies had burrowed deep in American society for years, trying to steal secrets and recruit agents. The FBI had watched Chapman and the others for months, recording drop-offs of packages and meetings on staircases. The US believes the group never got its hands on classified information, but the Russian infiltration into the US was a classic Moscow move. Within days, at the airport in Vienna, an elaborately choreographed transfer unfolded: the 10 Russians traded for four Russians charged with being in touch with Western intelligence services. But the US has also been caught in the act as well. In 2013, Ryan Fogle, a political secretary at the US embassy in Moscow, was arrested. The Russians claimed they caught him with wigs, dark glasses and cash as he tried to recruit a Russian agent. Fogle was expelled, though it was never clear if he was set up by the Russians. Relations have also occasionally turned violent: Earlier this year, a US diplomat was tackled and beaten by a uniformed Russian police officer as he tried to enter the American Embassy in Moscow. The US State Department expelled two Russian diplomats over the incident.

"We are surprised by the UK Prime Minister's office statement given that Secretary Kerry's remarks -- which covered the full range of threats to a two-state solution, including terrorism, violence, incitement and settlements -- were in-line with the UK's own longstanding policy and its vote at the United Nations last week," a spokesperson told CNN. In his speech, Kerry described the government of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as being the "most right-wing" in the country's history, with an "agenda driven by the most extreme elements." May's office said it was "not appropriate to attack the composition of a Democratically-elected ally." "The British government continues to believe that the only way to a lasting peace in the Middle East is through a two-state solution. We continue to believe that the construction of settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories is illegal, which is why we supported UN Security Council Resolution 2334 last week," May's office said in a statement. The statement continued, "We do not, therefore, believe that the way to negotiate peace is by focusing on only one issue, in this case the construction of settlements, when clearly the conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians is so deeply complex. And we do not believe that it is appropriate to attack the composition of the democratically-elected government of an ally." May's criticism of Kerry's speech is highly unusual given the close relationship between Britain and the US. But her office's remarks align closely with President-elect Donald Trump's criticism of the Obama administration's recent handling of Israel matters, and could be seen as a public attempt to grow closer with the incoming US president. Both May and Trump were swept into office earlier this year by populist waves. In his speech, Kerry defended the US decision last week to abstain from a vote on -- and not veto -- a UN resolution condemning Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem as one aimed at "preserving the two-state solution," which he called "the only way to achieve a just and lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians." He added, "Despite our best efforts over the years, the two-state solution is now in serious jeopardy." ©President-elect Donald Trump's inaugural committee Friday released an initial list of groups that have accepted an invitation to take part in the inaugural parade following the swearing in on January 20.

"Great move on delay (by V. Putin) - I always knew he was very smart!" Trump wrote on Twitter from his Florida resort. Earlier, Putin discarded a recommendation from his government to impose restrictions on the US in retaliation of President Barack Obama's decision to punish Moscow for its alleged meddling in the US presidential election. Trump immediately pinned the tweet to the top of his profile, meaning it is the first thing those visiting his page will see. The official account of the Russian Embassy then retweeted Trump. Trump's warm overtures to Putin have been the subject of much debate and controversy. The two exchanged compliments during Trump's campaign -- during which Trump often called for closer ties with Russia -- and Putin was one of the first world leaders to congratulate him after his victory in November. Last week, Trump received a Christmas letter from the Russian leader in which Putin expressed his hope for a more cordial relationship with the US, to which Trump said his thoughts were "so correct." Meanwhile, Trump has publicly expressed skepticism that Russia interfered in the 2016 election by hacking Democratic Party organizations, saying this week that Americans should "get on with our lives." In the wake of Obama's announcement of sanctions, however, Trump said he would review the intelligence next week. The sanctions announced Thursday by the Obama administration targeted four Russian individuals and five Russian entities over the election interference. The White House also ordered 35 Russian diplomats to leave the country and two Russian compounds, located in New York and Maryland, are being closed. Russian officials immediately vowed to retaliate, but on Friday morning, Putin said he would not pursue "irresponsible diplomacy." He said he would instead attempt to rebuild relations with Washington after Trump's inauguration next month.

Graff, who sits outside Trump's Trump Tower office as his assistant at the Trump Organization, is considering remaining in New York as her daughter is a junior in high school there. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks insisted that "no decisions have been made" and noted that "Rhona would be a tremendous asset." Graff has been a gatekeeper of access to the billionaire real estate developer and a constant presence around his business dealings for more than two decades. To reach Trump, business associates and other acquaintances have most often had to go through Graff, who sometimes provided a code system for callers who needed to get through to Trump. If Trump needs to find a new personal secretary to serve him in the White House that could be an adjustment for the billionaire businessman, who has relied on Graff as a loyal assistant for decades. Graff, who previously worked in marketing, joined the Trump Organization in 1987 as Trump's secretary and has served in the position since, though her duties have expanded as Trump's trust in her did as well. She currently holds the title of senior vice president and assistant to the president at the Trump Organization.

The incoming President wished a happy new year Saturday morning to all -- including his "many enemies." "Happy New Year to all, including to my many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don't know what to do. Love," Trump tweeted. The tweet evoked memories of another time Trump extended best wishes to "the haters and losers" -- September 11, 2013. "@realDonaldTrump: I would like to extend my best wishes to all, even the haters and losers, on this special date, September 11th." Trump has continued to criticize opponents and the media during his transition, and has been at odds with the Obama administration over its belief that Russia meddled in the 2016 election to aid his campaign. The President-elect has spent the holidays at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. Later Saturday, Vice president-elect Mike Pence offered a more traditional New Years greeting on Twitter. "Happy New Year! 2017 will be the year we Make America Great Again! We wish you every blessing for healthy & prosperous New Year! The Pences," he wrote.

Since his election, Trump has sat down with the likes of But Latino leaders say there's an urgent need for Trump to engage with the Hispanic community following a wrenching campaign in which he harshly singled out Mexican immigrants and called for tough immigration laws. The President-elect has not met with Latino organization leaders in any official capacity since winning the election, based on a review of his public meeting schedule. It's a conspicuous snub considering Trump's campaign rhetoric. He opened his White House bid in June 2015 by infamously labeling some Mexican immigrants as "rapists" and accusing them of bringing drugs and crime into the US. He also pledged to build a wall along the US-Mexico border, end birthright citizenship and deport all of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country, though he has since backed away from several of those stances. "It is unacceptable that he has yet to build a relationship with Latino and Muslim communities that he has targeted the most throughout his campaign," said Hector Sanchez, the chairman of the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda. "Communities that are now suffering because of the things he said." Brent Wilkes, the national executive director of the League of United Latin American Citizens, the oldest Hispanic civil rights organization in the US, said that it is unprecedented that the organization has still not heard from the President-elect. "We have always had Democratic and Republican presidents speak to us. Him not speaking to the Latino community is dividing this country," Wilkes said. Asked about whether Trump plans on reaching out to the Hispanic community, Hope Hicks, a transition spokeswoman, said Trump "will be a president for all Americans and will continue to reach out to specific groups and individuals as his Cabinet takes shape and he begins to execute plans for his first 100 days in office." But Wilkes said a lack of Latino representation in Trump's Cabinet is another issue that concerns the Hispanic community. As it currently stands, with all but two of his Cabinet picks made, Trump could be the first president in more than 24 years to not have someone of Latino heritage serve in his Cabinet. LULAC says the Trump transition team has not returned its phone calls. Michael Cohen, a top adviser to Trump though he is not a member of the transition team, told CNN that it's possible LULAC didn't reach the right people inside the transition, and were they to contact him, he would answer their calls. Cohen also insisted that Trump's transition team is making an effort to reach out to Hispanic groups, but he was unable to provide information on which groups the transition team has met with. He also said Trump has future plans to reach out to the Latino community, but he did not provide details. "President-elect Trump doesn't forget the groups that came out to support him," Cohen said. "And he does have plans to speak to the Latino community once he officially becomes president." Javier Palomarez, the president and CEO of United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce -- which And there were a handful of Latinos present for a But Janet Murguxc3xada, the president and CEO of the National Council of La Raza, the nation's largest Latino advocacy organization, said at a news conference in late November that Trump "needs to reassure, or at the very least, address the fears of the communities of which he will now be president." She added: "President-elect Trump, we need you to protect and defend all Americans and condemn the violence and hate being committed in your name." Asked about racial tensions in the wake of his election, Trump told CBS News he was "so saddened" to hear about threats and slurs hurled by some of his supporters against minorities. "If it helps, I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: Stop it," Trump told CBS' "60 Minutes." But there's more the President-elect can do to heal the country and reassure anxious Latinos about their place in Trump's America, Sanchez said. "I am still hoping one day that we will have an open dialogue with the President-elect," he said. "We need to make sure that our voices are still heard and not forgotten in this new administration."

The annual Mar-a-Lago New Year's Eve, which wife Melania and son Barron will also attend, is a highlight on the private club's social calendar, members say. One indicated that prices range from $525 for members to $575 for members' guests - in line with ticket prices in past years. The event is sold out, according to Trump's incoming White House press secretary, Sean Spicer. He said the bash would begin with cocktails in the mansion's living room, following by dinner and dancing in the Grand Ballroom. Trump himself added the ballroom onto Mar-a-Lago after purchasing the estate in 1985. The ornate space holds numerous annual fundraisers during the Palm Beach social season. Transition officials have downplayed the suggestion that purchasing tickets to Saturday's event may be akin to buying access to the President-elect, noting the New Year's Eve party is an annual event at the club that regularly sells out. For Saturday's event, florists and designers concocted a "sophisticated and elegant" scheme that incorporates 8,000 flowers on tables and overhead. "A lot of crystal, a lot of gold, a lot of candles," Steve Levine, the business manager for Jose Gratrol Designs, said of the party's decor. He said the Miami-based decoration company was planning a "special treatment with white flower garlands over the dance floor." He said his company submits its plans to Mar-a-Lago's director of catering, who then presents them to Melania and Donald Trump for approval. The same firm provided decoration for the past two New Years Eve parties at the estate, and Levine said this year's decoration is along the same lines, though specified they never repeat any decoration identically. The band for the evening: Party on the Moon, whose website hails the group as "America's #1 Corporate and Private Party Band." In a posting on the website, bandleader Dennis Smith said Party on the Moon had performed at an inaugural ball for President Barack Obama and would be honored to do the same for Trump. "If I get the call to perform for President-Elect Trump, we will be there. If Hillary Clinton gave us the call, we would be there," Smith wrote. "My life as an artist has nothing to do with my political choices." Smith, whose band has provided entertainment at Mar-a-Lago's New Years party the past five years, said the group planned a "non-stop four-hour show" for Trump and his guests. He said hits from Earth, Wind and Fire, Adele, and AC/DC were included in the set list. "He likes upbeat music more," Smith said of Trump's musical preferences. "He doesn't care for the laid back stuff." Smith didn't anticipate this year's performance would differ greatly from past events at Mar-a-Lago. He said the band hadn't prepared a rendition of "Hail to the Chief." In past years, celebrities like Vanessa Williams, Regis Philbin and Rod Stewart have attended the party, according to the Palm Beach Post. At Mar-a-Lago Friday, Italian-American model Fabio was spotted entering the club. Spicer said Friday that notable guests attending this year included Sylvester Stallone and Quincy Jones. However, Jones tweeted that he would be in Los Angeles for the holiday: "Looking forward to spending New Year's Eve & the whole weekend w/my kids, & friends in LA. Be safe yawl & have a Happy New Year." Mar-a-Lago, a sprawling Italianate estate with fountains, pools and a croquet lawn, was originally intended by its builder to serve as a "Winter White House," though it has never acted in that capacity until now. Trump has relished the grandiosity of the estate, summoning potential Cabinet picks for meetings there at the same time regular members shuffle through the stately living and dining rooms.

"He made a last-minute trip to Jupiter. We weren't aware and appreciate everyone's understanding. We are in the home stretch of this transition period and don't anticipate any additional situations like this between now and inauguration," Trump spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham told reporters. "We've really made an effort to provide as much access and comfort as possible over the past two weeks and are proud of the way we have all worked together." A club member tweeted a picture of the President-elect with himself at Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter, Florida, which alerted reporters to the President-elect's visit. The Jupiter club is about a half hour away from his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, where he is staying. Trump's motorcade was seen leaving the club around 2:15 p.m. ET. The press pool, a small group of journalists assigned to cover the president, exists to keep Americans informed about the president's whereabouts. In the case of an emergency, the president and his team often relies on journalists to quickly relay information to the American people.

"This is no job for impulsive, timid or inattentive souls," Roberts wrote in the report, which sheds light each year on an issue the chief justice believes should receive the public's attention. Roberts' message comes as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to fill a Supreme Court vacancy and reshape the lower courts. There are currently more than a In past years, the chief's reports have emphasized issues such as judicial pay, budget cuts and recusal rules. Roberts, a keen student of the history of the Supreme Court, almost always manages to weave in historical references. This year's report details George Washington's role in appointing 13 original United States district judges, a list that included a general in the Revolutionary War, a signer of the Declaration of Independence and a poet and musician. "These individuals are not well known in our era, but they launched the new system of United States District Courts and set the course for the important role those institutions would come to play in the new republic," Roberts wrote. Turning to present day judges, Roberts said that they are not often the focus of public attention but that they play a "crucial role." "You might be asking," Roberts wrote, "why any lawyer would want a job that requires long hours, exacting skill and intense devotion -- while promising high stress, solitary confinement and guaranteed criticism." Roberts continued: "The answer lies in the rewards of public service." Congress has authorized 673 district court judgeships. Although Roberts said that "unlike politicians, they work largely outside of the public eye," he did not mention the fact that sometimes district court judges find themselves in the middle of a political storm, as when district court Judge Andrew S.

Speaking to reporters ahead of an 800-person New Year's Eve bash at his Mar-a-Lago estate, a tuxedoed Trump maintained that another culprit aside from Russia could have been behind the tampering. "It could be somebody else. And I also know things that other people don't know, and so they cannot be sure of the situation," he said. Asked to describe what undisclosed information he knew, Trump said, "You'll find out on Tuesday or Wednesday." Trump has scheduled an intelligence briefing midweek on the hacking, a response to President Barack Obama's announcement of new sanctions on Moscow in retaliation for the cyber-intrusion. "I just want them to be sure, because it's a pretty serious charge, and I want them to be sure. And if you look at the weapons of mass destruction, that was a disaster, and they were wrong," Trump said, referencing failed intelligence in the lead-up to the Iraq War as a reason for skepticism. "I think it's unfair if they don't know," he said. "And I know a lot about hacking. And hacking is a very hard thing to prove." Trump has repeatedly cast aside a US intelligence assessment announced in early October that Moscow was behind the hacking, despite already receiving classified intelligence briefings on the matter. He's also praised Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling him smart this week for withholding reciprocal sanctions on the US. Trump's stance has put him at odds with most congressional Republicans, who have argued for a tougher stance on Russia. Sen. John McCain, the Republican chairman of the Armed Services Committee, will convene a hearing on cyber-threats Thursday. On Sunday morning, a Rossiya Airlines Special Flight Squadron plane believed to be carrying some expelled Russian government officials departed Dulles Airport just outside Washington. The US had ordered 35 officials and their families from the embassy in Washington and the consulate in San Francisco to leave the country by noon Sunday in response to charges that Russians hacked the presidential election and harassed US diplomatic personnel in Russia. A State Department official told CNN early Sunday evening all of the expelled Russian diplomats have left the US. "We can confirm that the 35 Russian diplomats declared persona non grata have, along with their family members, departed the United States.," the official said. Congressional Democrats on Sunday scoffed at Trump's assertion that Russian involvement wasn't clear. "It's very solid," said Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence committee, on ABC's "This Week."

"I don't care what they say, no computer is safe."

Tapper then asked if the former Florida governor is open to backing Trump's support for a 35% tax or tariff on businesses wanting to take American jobs overseas. "Yes," Crist replied. "It's all about jobs and making sure that we have American jobs protected, we protect the American worker, give them the opportunity to be able to provide for their families, get a college education." "Any good idea that is presented, we have to be open-minded to receive it," said Crist, who supported Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. "I mean, just because the messenger is somebody that was in a different party is no reason to cast it out." Trump has said he plans to charge a 35% tax for "any business that leaves our country for another country, fires its employees, builds a new factory or plant in the other country, and ...

Harry Hurt III, who penned "Lost Tycoon: The Many Lives of Donald J. Trump," says he was preparing for a round at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach late last week and introduced himself to the billionaire Republican, who was on a practice range. In an interview on CNN's "New Day," Hurt said he had seen Trump while playing the course about a year and a half earlier -- and that Trump had joked about Hurt's knickers. He said in 2007 or 2008, Trump clipped his review of nearby Emerald Dunes and hand-wrote a note to Hurt saying the Trump International course "was much better. You should come play." That, he said, led him to believe Trump had no hurt feelings resulting from the 23-year-old book. Hurt said he approached Trump on the golf course Friday "out of courtesy" as Hurt's foursome -- including Republican mega-donor David Koch -- got set to start its round. He said he's not sure what changed Friday. "Donald will continue to exhibit the erratic behavior he has exhibited his entire life," Hurt said. Hurt first said Trump kicked him off the golf course in a post on his Facebook page Saturday. "Hurt, who has a scratch handicap and plays in colorful knickers, walked over to Trump on the practice range prior to his group's assigned tee time, only to suffer a tongue lashing from the President-elect," read the post. Hurt said he shook Trump's hand and offered his congratulations, a gesture he said wasn't reciprocated by the President-elect. "Trump said, 'You were rough on me, Harry. Really rough. That s--- you wrote,' " read the Facebook post. Hurt's book, first published in 1993, contained reporting that Trump's first wife Ivana had accused the real estate developer of rape during their divorce. Trump adamantly denies the charge, and Ivana has said while she felt "violated" during their marriage, she didn't intend her accusation to be taken in "a literal or criminal sense." On the golf course in Florida Friday, Hurt said he "looked Trump in the eye, and said, 'It's all true,' to which Trump responded, 'Not in the way you wrote it,' " according to the post on Facebook. He said Trump had his security detail escort him and three of his friends, which included the billionaire industrialist and major Republican donor David Koch, to the parking lot. John Damgard, another member of Hurt's group, confirmed that Trump asked them to leave the course. "We were on the putting green," Damgard, a Republican donor, said. "Harry came and said 'Mr. Trump doesn't want us to play.' We went to a different place." But he said some details in Hurt's account weren't accurate. "We had no interaction with security," Damgard told CNN in a phone interview. Damgard said the group was not escorted off the course. Hurt wrote the foursome went instead to Emerald Dunes, which he called "a much, much better golf course than Trump International." Officials with Trump's transition team did not respond to a request for comment. Reached Sunday, Hurt declined to elaborate on his telling of events. Koch, who is a member at the Trump International course, "loves the club," according to Damgard, but wouldn't have chosen to play there if he'd known it would cause consternation for the President-elect. Damgard said neither he nor Koch were aware of the critical biography Hurt had written. "Obviously it was something he didn't like. It is his golf course and it certainly it is his right" to remove a player, Damgard said. "Obviously it was something he didn't like.

And which White House traditions might go out the window? We asked some top political reporters what stories they're watching closely in the new year. Here's what they told us, in this week's "Inside Politics" forecast. President-elect Donald Trump has made it clear he's going to run the White House in his own way. Whether it was his frequent tweets, his unorthodox inner circle or his so-called outsider style of politics, Trump won the election by being himself. But will the President-elect change once he enters the White House? That's question has caught the eye of Matt Viser of the Boston Globe. "He is a radical departure, as we know, from just about anything we've seen in modern politics," explains Viser. "2017, to me, is going to be marked by change, and ... him taking over these things, like a state dinner, the White House Correspondents' Dinner, press conferences, tweeting, his relationships with Congress. I think he is so unconventional, and he's taking over an office that is steeped in tradition. "So the question is, how much will he conform to these offices? And how much will he upend them?" While it's tough to predict what a President Trump will look like, we do know the incoming administration has promised all kinds of White House protocol changes. Reince Priebus, who's been named Chief of Staff, and newly-named Press Secretary Sean Spicer haven't been specific about the changes. But as NPR's Domenico Montanaro reports, they are laser-focused on the customs involving press. "Things like press conferences and assigned seating, which sounds kind of arcane, but actually started in 1981 as a way for administrations, both Republican and Democratic, to not show favoritism or an appearance of favoritism toward any specific reporter," Montanaro reports. "But what's gotten under the skin of some of the Trump transition officials is that they think that a lot of reporters do a lot of showboating in the White House." When President Obama was sworn into office, some Republicans made it their mission to be a thorn in the White House's side. They wouldn't be quieted and they wouldn't be ignored. Now, the shoe's on the other foot. In 2017, it's Democrats who are the minorities in the House and Senate. As Jackie Kucinich of the Daily Beast explains, they'll be the group to watch beyond the White House. "When Obama was elected, Republicans very quickly made themselves a force to be reckoned with and [they] could not be ignored. Can Democrats do the same in 2017? " asks Kucinich. "Who's going to emerge as the leader of that effort? They're about to watch everything they hold near and dear either changed or dismantled entirely. How hard are they going to fight? And will they be effective in getting their way on anything?" Now that the country has elected a new president, all eyes are on the White House and one big policy question: What happens to Obamacare? The Washington Post's Karen Tumulty believes efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act could become the story to watch in 2017. And she poses some questions that come along with that narrative. "Do the Republicans have a plan? Will they be able to come up with a plan that can actually cover ... (the) 20 million or so who've gotten benefits under it (Obamacare)?" she asks. " And also, can the Democrats face up to the fact that there have been some problems in affordability, in sort of the scope of coverage of Obamacare as it stands?" Look for answers in early 2017. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said replacing Obamacare is one of Republicans' first priorities for the new year. Look for answers in early 2017.

Jeff Sessions' confirmation hearings for the post of attorney general, citing gaps in his record that the Alabama Republican didn't address in Sessions, like other nominees of President-elect Donald Trump, is on course for a committee vote before Trump is inaugurated on January 20. But three liberal groups -- the National Council of Asian Pacific Americans, People For the American Way and Alliance for Justice -- say his January 10 confirmation hearing should be delayed. The groups say Sessions failed to provide media interviews, speeches, op-eds and more from his time as US attorney in Alabama, the state's attorney general and from his first term as senator, from 1997 through 2002. They said Sessions listed just 20 media interviews, 16 speeches outside the Senate, two op-eds, an academic article and a training manual, as well as just 11 clips of interviews with print publications -- including none prior to 2003. "Sen. Sessions claims that records do not exist for the vast majority of press interviews he has given over the years. However, many are easily located online," the groups said, calling the omission "inexplicable." Aides helping with Sessions' confirmation did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But the office of Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Charles Grassley said Trump's choice for the post has been forthcoming with information. "The notion that Senator Sessions -- somebody who committee members have known and served beside for 20 years -- hasn't made a good faith effort to supply the committee with responsive material is preposterous," said a spokeswoman for Grassley, an Iowa Republican.

"There are any number of things that you could point to to say that it was a mistake that we made that probably has some merit to it, because it was such a perfect storm of a lot of different things," Karen Finney told CNN's Jake Tapper in an interview that aired Sunday on "State of the Union." "But one of the things I think is important as we think about going forward is I don't think this is an issue where there's just a magic bullet ... A majority of those people agreed with her on the economy, thought she'd be better on the economy. And she's won 2.8 million more in the popular vote." Finney didn't provide further specifics. But she said the Democratic Party has a lot of work to do going forward. "I think we need to learn some of the lessons coming out of this election, no question, in terms of how we talk to working families -- whether they are black, white, brown and where those families are located -- how we talk to them about the issues that they care about," she said. "But I don't think that this is an example of 'there was one or two things that was just flip a switch and everything will be perfect.'" Finney's view on Clinton's election loss differs from comments from her former colleagues. Clinton's former campaign manager, Robby Mook, told Tapper in December that Russian intervention in the election played a role.

Marsha Blackburn says she has been discussing legislation to make child care more affordable for working Americans with the President-elect's daughter, Ivanka Trump. "I am delighted to see that we're looking at options for tax credits, tax incentives, ways for moms and dads to be able to write-off this child-care cost," Blackburn told CNN's Jake Tapper on "State of the Union," which aired Sunday. "One of the things that is most troubling as a mom in the workforce is finding child care and being certain that your children are safe and well cared for and not feeling like they are going to miss out on things because you put yourself on the guilt bus," she added. The Tennessee Republican, who owns a small business, said she had concerns about child care as she was raising her kids. "It was so very difficult. It's one of the things I struggled with as my children were growing up," she said. President-elect Donald Trump's daughter met Blackburn told Tapper she backed those proposals. "You want to know your children are well cared for," she said.

Obama began a seven-message series of tweets by saying: "As we look ahead to the future, I wanted to take a moment to look back on the remarkable progress that you made possible these past 8 years." He touted "the longest streak of job growth in our history" and said that "after decades of rising health care costs, today nearly every American now has access to the financial security of affordable health care." The two-term Democratic president also highlighted moves toward green energy, the ends of foreign conflicts and the legalization of same-sex marriage. Obama concluded by writing: "It's been the privilege of my life to serve as your President. I look forward to standing with you as a citizen. Happy New Year everybody." Obama's tweet-storm came as Sean Spicer, Trump's incoming White House press secretary, said on ABC's "This Week" that He didn't specify which executive actions Trump will repeal. But Trump has long been critical of Obama's moves on immigration, energy regulation and foreign policy, and could look for ways to undo those and other actions. Obama has used Twitter before, but never as frequently as his successor, President-elect Donald Trump. The tweets come as Obama's @POTUS handle is set to be transitioned to Trump.

Members of the transition team are meeting this week to discuss what actions the incoming president will undertake on day one, a source told CNN Monday. Sean Spicer, Trump's incoming White House press secretary, said on ABC's "This Week" that Trump will immediately "repeal a lot of the regulations and actions that have been taken by this administration over the last eight years that have hampered both economic growth and job creation." It was one of two moves Spicer said Trump will make immediately after he takes the oath of office. He didn't specify which executive actions Trump will repeal. However, Trump has long been critical of Obama's moves on immigration, energy regulation and foreign policy, and could look for ways to undo those and other actions. Spicer also said Trump will begin reforms intended to "bring a new brand to Washington" with a restriction on members of his administration becoming lobbyists for a period of five years after they leave Trump's government. "It's very forward-thinking," Spicer said. "What we've had in the past is people who have looked in the rearview mirror. This time, we're thinking forward. If you want to serve in a Trump administration, you're going to serve this country, not yourself." Historically on Inauguration Day, presidents have signed executive orders as well as presidential orders presenting the nomination of Cabinet officials. But some of those executive orders never amount to much. For example, on his Inauguration Day, President Barack Obama announced a number of executive orders, including one mandating the prompt closure of the US prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Eight years later, the prison remains open. But some of those executive orders never amount to much.

"You have to understand, I think that the Clinton days are over," Jones told CNN's Jake Tapper in an interview that aired Sunday on "State of the Union." "This idea that we're going to be this moderate party that's going to move in this direction, that's going to throw blacks under the bus for criminal justice reform, and for prison expansion, that's going to throw workers under the bus for NAFTA, those days are over." He added that Kamala Harris, a California Democrat who was just elected to the US Senate, is "unreal." "She's going to be out there defending those DREAMer kids because they're a big part of her constituency," he said. "But she's got African-American roots. She's got Asian roots. She's female. She's tough. She's smart. She's going to become a big deal." Jones also called Democratic Rep. Keith Ellison, the first Muslim elected to Congress who is eying the Democratic National Committee chairmanship, "important" because he's progressive. "I think that Keith Ellison is very important because he is somebody who represents the progressive wing of the party," he said. "One thing that happened, when Hillary Clinton had a chance to make a VP pick, she didn't pick someone from the progressive wing, which made it much harder to heal those wounds with the (Bernie) Sanders and Elizabeth Warren wing.

At a New Year's Eve party at his Mar-A-Lago estate, a tuxedoed Trump maintained that another culprit aside from Russia could have been behind the election intrusion."It could be somebody else. And I also know things that other people don't know, and so they cannot be sure of the situation," he said. Asked to describe what undisclosed information he knew, Trump said: "You'll find out on Tuesday or Wednesday." The latest developments in Trump's denial of the American intelligence community's assessment -- widely accepted by both Democrats and Republicans -- that Russia hacked Democratic operatives' emails in a bid to help Trump defeat Hillary Clinton will be among the leading political stories this week, as Trump's transition efforts resume and a new Congress is sworn in. Here are five other political stories to watch this week: The Russia hacks aren't just driving a wedge between Trump and the Obama administration. Some Republicans on Capitol Hill are backing Obama's moves last week to sanction Russia, and are calling for legislation to add even more sanctions on top of those announced by the White House. The Senate Armed Services Committee, chaired by Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain, will hold a hearing on cyberthreats and the election-related hacking Thursday. The issue could set the tone for relations between Trump and the Republican majorities in the House and Senate. The newly elected Congress will begin its work Tuesday at noon with a vote to officially re-elect Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan as House speaker. Several new faces will appear in Congress, including Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and former Republican Florida governor and Senate candidate Charlie Crist, who is set to become a Democratic congressman. So will Florida's Brian Mast, a Republican and Army veteran who lost both of his legs in Afghanistan. An old face, meanwhile, will appear in the Senate. Vice President Joe Biden will be back in the body where he spent more than three decades to swear in new senators, including California's Kamala Harris and Nevada's Catherine Cortez Masto, who replaces retiring Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid. The Senate will quickly move toward confirmation battles over Trump's nominees -- with Democrats complaining that nominees aren't submitting materials they've requested, including their financial information and shouldn't get hearings and votes until those are provided. House Republicans, meanwhile, will condemn the Obama administration's handling of a United Nations vote on Israeli settlements on the West Bank. And House Democrats are opposing a GOP-backed rule change that would impose new fines for members who break rules of decorum. It's an effort to stop Democrats from using platforms such as Periscope and Meerkat to live-stream sit-ins on the House floor, as they did last year. President Barack Obama will make an unusual trip for a lame-duck president -- visiting Capitol Hill on Wednesday morning to meet with congressional Democrats and discuss how to fight Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is set to push the repeal of Obama's signature domestic achievement in the first week of the new Congress. Democrats, meanwhile, face a defining moment in the early stages of the Trump era: If party members pledge not to help the GOP pass any replacement, it would place enormous pressure on Trump and congressional Republicans to come up with a way to keep 20 million Americans insured -- and get Congress to approve such a program. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi will hold a conference call with House Democrats Monday on Obamacare. What else can Obama get done before leaving office? He's still working toward closing the Guantanamo Bay detention facility and could make additional pardons. His farewell speech will also be formally announced Monday. After a holiday getaway at his Mar-A-Lago estate, Trump has several cabinet positions left to fill. He's expected to soon announce his choices for secretary of Veterans Affairs and Agriculture. Other key roles remain unfilled, as well -- including solicitor general, where top aide Kellyanne Conway's husband George Conway is reportedly a candidate, as well as Director of National Intelligence and deputy secretary of state. Trump will attempt to conclude a piece of older business this week with a deposition at Trump Tower this week. The deposition comes as part of Trump's legal battle with the chef Jose Andres. Andres was supposed to launch a restaurant in the new Trump International Hotel in Washington. But after Trump's attacks on Mexicans as he began his presidential campaign in June 2015, Andres withdrew, and Trump sued him for breach of contract. ©While the world watches President-elect Donald Trump take the oath of office on Inauguration Day, almost 100 White House staffers will be watching the clock while they have only six hours to transform and prepare the 132-room mansion into the new first family's home. On the morning of January 20, President Barack Obama and the current first family will say goodbye to the place they've called home for eight years, at 10:30 in the morning. Immediately after they leave their former home, White House staff rushes to prepare it for Trump and his family according to their own preferences and style. Movers plan to take the Obamas' belongings out to trucks on the South Lawn facing away from the White House and move the incoming first family's belongings inside from trucks on the other side of the driveway. "It's more like organized chaos," Chief White House usher Stephen Rochon told Jake Tapper on CNN's "State of the Union" in an interview that aired Sunday. While movers hurry back and forth, other areas of the White House are set up including new touches to the dining rooms. The kitchen staff also cooks up an inaugural snack for the first family to enjoy before they attend the late night inaugural balls. Rochon said anything can be changed on the second and third floors of the White House, which are used as the private floors for the first family. One of Obama's main requests upon moving in was a special rain shower head for his bathroom, Rochon. said. As far as Trump's requests, the President-elect told Tapper that he does not have plans to redecorate the White House in his signature opulent style saying, "It's a very special place. ... I'm going to be working. I'm not going to be decorating."

President Obama said he was following the precedent set by George Washington, who penned a farewell address to the American people over 220 years ago. George W. Bush also delivered a farewell address in 2009 from the White House. "Since 2009, we've faced our fair share of challenges, and come through them stronger," Obama wrote Monday. "That's because we have never let go of a belief that has guided us ever since our founding -- our conviction that, together, we can change this country for the better." President Obama has said that while he won't weigh in on every issue once he is out of the White House, he would consider speaking up about issues that go to "core questions" about American values and ideals.

The Republican-controlled Congress returns Tuesday to begin an aggressive push on a range of policies that their new partner -- President-elect Donald Trump -- can help turn into law. The focus in January will be to start the wheels in motion to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, and vote to confirm many of Trump's Cabinet nominees. There will also be debate about Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election -- an issue the incoming President doesn't want to focus on, saying last week it's time to "move on" -- but many in his own party view as a serious threat. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is aiming to secure confirmation for many of Trump's top national security and economic team members around the time he is sworn in on January 20. While Democrats don't have the votes to block Trump's nominees, they are signaling an intense fight nevertheless. They are planning to leverage the high-profile committee hearings to draw contrasts with Republicans on key issues like health care, the environment and foreign policy. "Repeal and replace" has been the regular Republican refrain from virtually the day President Barack Obama's signature health care law became law in 2010. McConnell announced last month that the first vote of the new Congress will be to start dismantling Obamacare. The President isn't going quietly. Obama is scheduled to visit Capitol Hill on Wednesday for a rare meeting with all House and Senate Democrats to "discuss fighting GOP plans to repeal (the Affordable Care Act)," according to a senior Senate Democratic aide. The high-profile visit signals that the President will be personally involved defending the law that stands as his most important domestic policy legacy. Now that they have a GOP president to actually sign legislation that rolls back the law, congressional Republicans are acknowledging that it's complicated to simultaneously repeal Obamacare and put something else in its place. They control both the House and the Senate but they are limited because they don't have 60 votes in the Senate to overcome a Democratic filibuster that would be expected on efforts to get rid of Obamacare. Their plan is to use a budget process known as "reconciliation" to wipe away the major planks of Obamacare. The Senate will begin debating a budget resolution this week as the first step. That allows them to use the procedure to pass the repeal in the Senate with a simple majority, avoiding an expected Democratic filibuster. Reconciliation rules do limit the items in the law that can be rolled back to those that have a direct impact on the federal budget, and Republicans still don't have all the details ready on which ones they will include. Democrats are preparing an aggressive public relations campaign to highlight how Obamacare has helped the 20 million now covered because of the law, and the other benefits they believe have occurred, such as better preventive care. On a conference call with House Democrats last week, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi touted that the ACA lowered costs and improved outcomes for millions. She compared the fight ahead against Republicans to the one she led in 2005 and 2006 when then-President George W. Bush traveled around the country championing a proposal to privatize Social Security, a plan that didn't gain traction with the public or in Congress. Events in House congressional districts are planned for January 7, and Senate Democrats are also teeing up several events in Washington this week to remind people about the elements of Obamacare they believe are popular. Pelosi, incoming Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders announced that January 15 is a national "Our First Stand: Save Health Care" day of action for advocacy groups and Democrats to criticize Republicans for working to target the health care law, as well as other entitlement programs such as Medicare. While Republicans can pass the budget measure relatively quickly over a few weeks to begin unwinding Obamacare, the package that will contain the actual plans for repealing the law will take at least a couple of months to develop. Several committees in both the House and Senate will weigh in with their stamps on the details, including which taxes will go and which ones may need to remain in place until a new replacement plan is put in place. Democrats are also bracing for a big fight over funding for Planned Parenthood, an issue that has triggered multiple standoffs in the past with the GOP. It's unclear whether Republicans will include a ban on funding for the women's health care provider because of its role in providing abortion services as part of the initial budget bill. There is no consensus yet on when to address the issue, but conservatives are pressing for action soon and view the reconciliation process as the place to tackle it. Republicans are also struggling to come to consensus on how quickly they need to lay out their proposal to stand up a new health care system to take Obamacare's place. Conservatives are insisting they limit any transition period to two years. But GOP leaders are wary that once they begin unraveling the complicated federal and state programs now providing coverage, it will take three years or more to practically implement a new system. Multiple Republican aides say it's more likely that replacement plans will be voted on in a piecemeal fashion over multiple years, perhaps even after the 2018 midterm elections, to ensure there are not major marketplace disruptions or economic fallout for insurers, states or the private sector. Trump's transition team describes the mix of business leaders and former military leaders selected for Cabinet posts as a group of outsiders set to shakeup the way Washington works. Republicans are confident that they have solid support and will get help of many of the red state Democrats, like West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, to confirm them. So far, Rex Tillerson, the oil company CEO Trump tapped to serve as secretary of state, is the only pick who is raising some concerns with a handful of Republicans. They want more information about his close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin and how he will deal with myriad foreign policy issues where the US has tangled with Russia like Syria, Iran and recent cyberattacks. Democrats are complaining that Tillerson, and many other Cabinet nominees, have been "very slow" in providing information to the committees ahead of the upcoming hearings that committee chairs are targeting to hold in the second week in January. They are threatening to drag out votes on nominees if they don't receive complete financial disclosure and ethics reports in advance of hearings so Senators can review the materials. "Republicans shouldn't expect their nominees to sail through if those nominees won't provide the disclosure that past nominees provided and that senators, and the American public, deserve," Matt House, a spokesman for Schumer, told CNN. Any delay would just be symbolic, but if Democrats use the full amount of debate time allowed under Senate rules, then a vote on each nominee that would normally take place in one or two days could stretch out a week. That could mean it could take months to clear through all of the president's nominees if Democrats decide to put up a fight, and other priorities like Obamacare repeal could also be delayed. Democrats have been critical of virtually every person Trump has selected, but they realize they can't wage war on all of them. In addition to highlighting conflicts Tillerson's business dealings might present, multiple Senate Democratic sources say they are digging into the stock trades of Georgia Republican Rep. Tom Price, Trump's pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services. Under the law known as the "STOCK Act" Price has disclosed information about his trades involving health and pharmaceutical company stocks. One senior Democratic leadership aide suggested they view the issue of conflicts arising from votes in Price's post as budget chair coming around the time of these financial transactions as "seriously, seriously troubling." There is no evidence of any wrongdoing by Price. Phil Blando, a spokesman for Trump's transition team, had previously told CNN Price "complied fully with all applicable laws and ethics rules governing his personal finances." And if confirmed would comply with the law, Blando added. Obama's announcement last week of new sanctions against Russia for its cyberattacks during the presidential election are putting Hill Republicans in a tough spot. Virtually all the top GOP leaders in Congress publicly backed the sanctions, although they criticized how long it took to put them in place, along with the administration's overall foreign policy. US intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia carried out a steady and deliberate cyberoperation targeting top Democrats email accounts and the Democratic National Committee. Senate Armed Service Chairman John McCain, R-Arizona, is holding a Thursday hearing on the threat posed by foreign governments targeting US computer systems, including Russia, which will be the first public hearing since agencies revealed the links they found to Russia in the attacks. McCain, along with South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, have vowed to draft legislation imposing additional sanctions to penalize Russia, and Democrats have agreed to craft a bipartisan proposal. Both McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan have publicly denounced Russia's moves, but any bipartisan push to move sanctions legislation puts them in the precarious spot of using valuable time in the first 100 days of the new administration on an issue that puts them at odds with Trump. Democrats are criticizing new Republican proposed rules governing decorum in the chamber of the House of Representatives. In response to a summer sit-in that Democrats used to take over the House floor, GOP leaders are adding a provision to impose fines as high as $2,500 for any member who uses social media application to broadcast activities from the floor. Some Democrats are calling the proposal "unconstitutional," "a gag rule" and "Putinesque," but the changes are expected to pass. It's unclear if a legal challenge could force the GOP to back down.

Crucial elections loom this year in France and Germany, where the same anti-establishment backlash that produced Donald Trump and The Middle East is spiraling deeper into the mire of fraying borders and sectarian disorder while violence in places such Of course, the 15 years since the September 11 attacks have been dominated by war, strife and economic disruption. But what makes 2017 so unique is that America -- long a force for stability -- is poised to inaugurate one of the most impulsive presidents ever to walk into the Oval Office. Far from acting as a brake against turmoil sweeping the globe, America under Trump could exacerbate it. Nicholas Dungan, an Atlantic Council senior fellow, said uncertainty about the President-elect could widen divides in the transatlantic alliance, the bedrock of 70 years of Western stability. "Donald Trump is in many respects the anti-Barack Obama," said Dungan, who teaches at Sciences Po, an international research university in France. "With Obama, there was tremendous trust but very little performance. With Trump it looks like there will be a deficit of trust and a surfeit of action." It's no wonder that Trump has the world on edge, despite arguments among supporters that the unpredictable statesmanship he has previewed in the presidential transition could strengthen the US position around the globe by keeping rivals off balance. He has questioned US alliances that kept the peace for decades in Europe and Asia and suggested he will "expand" the US nuclear arsenal. He has spent his transition The Trump effect could be all the more pronounced because the political equilibrium of much of the world has been upset, straining institutions and assumptions in international relations that have endured for decades. To judge how much has changed, and why the prospects of 2017 look so uncertain, it's worth looking back a year. When 2016 dawned, Obama, fresh from an In Britain, David Cameron was basking in a surprising parliamentary majority won in a 2015 election. Most end-of-year polls predicted the Remain camp would win a referendum on membership in the European Union. In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel, And in Italy, Prime Minister Matteo Renzi was readying a trip to the US to receive Obama's blessing after harnessing hope and change as a successful political message of his own. But within months, the unthinkable happened -- again, and again, and again. In a blink of an eye, Cameron was gone, felled by a referendum in which voters who felt economically and culturally dispossessed opted to leave the EU. Trump won the US election after a vitriolic campaign that tore at social, cultural and political divides and left the rest of the world confused about American power and identity. Renzi is history, crushed Cameron-style by his own referendum defeat which dealt a second hammer blow to the EU. And Merkel, rocked by a year-end terror attack in Berlin, In France, where Islamic terrorism has become more frequent, President Francois Hollande acknowledged his dismal approval rating and A March election in the Netherlands promises a strong showing by far right leader Geert Wilders built on skepticism towards Brussels that is threatening the existence of the EU. Still if Merkel or an establishment rival prevails in Germany, and the hot favorite in the polls to win the French presidency, Francois Fillon, is also victorious, 2017 could be remembered as the year the populist revolt began to ebb. As the West reels, its adversaries are mobilizing. Russian President Vladimir Putin defied Obama's predictions his venture in Syria would end in a quagmire. Now, he seems on the way to restoring the lost Russian influence that he watched ebb in despair after the fall of the Soviet Union. In Asia, Chinese President Xi Jinping is accelerating that country's accumulation of regional power and challenging US influence and allies in the South China Sea. A volatile President in the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, is trashing a prized US alliance. Trump's rejection of a vast Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact has already The instability and uncertainty makes the choices Trump makes once he is inaugurated in January especially crucial. Should the new administration follow through on the President-elect's tough rhetoric on China and take protectionist steps that could incite a trade war, tensions in Asia could spike considerably. If Trump walks out on the Iran nuclear deal or infringes the Paris climate pact, he could send transatlantic relations into a spiral. Aligning the US closer to Moscow could also alarm European allies unless he makes a full-throated defense of NATO on his first trip to the continent. Asian allies Japan and South Korea are nervously trying to work out what Trump's campaign trail rhetoric means for crucial national security infrastructure in Asia. North Korea, meanwhile, is brewing what could be Trump's first big foreign crisis with its race for a functioning nuclear arsenal. In the Middle East, Trump's vow to move the US embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv could light a match to Of course, there's no certainty that Trump will plunge the world into a new spiral of instability. Major policy shifts can be disorienting, but they aren't always negative. Every President's foreign policy is in some ways a correction to that of his predecessor. So Trump's spontaneity could perhaps be an antidote to Obama's caution, which some critics said frittered away US power. Questioning trade deals, alliances and conventions could actually end up strengthening the US at home and in the world, Trump supporters argue. And just because the One China policy has dictated relations between Washington and Beijing for decades does not mean it should always be so, they say. Trump's naval buildup, meanwhile, could reassure US allies who feel bullied by China. And in an era of strongman leaders like Xi, Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, a harder-to-read US President might keep American rivals off balance. Foreign policy often begins at home. And if tax cuts and slashing regulation ignites explosive economic growth, a Trump boom could help lift anemic economies in Euorope and Asia. Those who hope Trump will not upset the geopolitical apple cart also question whether responsibility will sober the President-elect. "There's just a whole different attitude and vibe when you're not in power as when you're in power," Obama said in his year-end press conference. "What we have to see is how will the President-elect operate and how will his team operate when they've been fully briefed on all these issues, they have their hands on all the levers of government and they've got to got to start making decisions."

Now, as congressional Republicans prepare to repeal the law, Democrats are asking voters to "take a second look." On a call Monday with top Democrats, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said one thing she would have done differently on health care reform from the start was "message it in a much stronger way." Pelosi, who as speaker presided over the House when Obamacare became law, stressed that millions of Americans now enjoy the law's benefits and said Democrats are focusing in the coming weeks on emphasizing the law's individual provisions. "I would just say to the American people: Take a second look," Pelosi said. The alternative, Pelosi argued, is that Republicans will leave millions of Americans without health insurance -- and worsen the coverage of many more -- with no clear plan for what will follow. Her comments come the day before Congress returns to Washington, with Republicans set to adopt changes to the House rules to make it easier to undo Obama's signature domestic achievement. GOP lawmakers are expected to repeal the law, while giving themselves a period of potentially two years or more to craft and approve its replacement. Obama and Vice President-elect Mike Pence will be on Capitol Hill Wednesday to talk Obamacare. Pence will huddle with House Republicans to discuss the repeal while Obama is scheduled to meet with House and Senate Democrats to continue developing the party's strategy to fight the GOP's effort. While Democrats don't have the votes to prevent the repeal from moving through Congress, they are relying on a high profile public relations campaign to highlight the benefits of the law. On Monday, they began mentioning specific cases where constituents saved money or had a family member survive a major illness due to Obamacare. Pelosi signaled that Democrats won't be willing to help Republicans replace Obamacare. "It's the old thing of going into a china shop -- you break it, you own it," she said. On Tuesday, House members will vote on some Republican proposals to change the rules that govern how legislation is considered on the House floor. Democrats are pointing to two new provisions added in the package for the new Congress that they say are designed to help the GOP effort to repeal Obamacare. One change would allow exceptions to the rule instituted by House Republicans in their recent budget plan that limits votes on any legislation that increases the federal deficit by $5 billion over a specific period. Pelosi said of the change, "they really admit that by repealing the Affordable Care Act you will increase costs." Democrats also say that another change dealing with committee oversight could open up federal entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security to potential funding cuts. The new GOP rule directs certain committees to draft recommendations for shifting these programs from the mandatory side of the federal ledger to the discretionary side. If implemented, that change could mean Congress would decide funding details for all of these programs as annual spending bills, potentially removing the automatic funding stream they now receive. Pelosi also argued Republicans haven't offered even broad concepts for how they'd replace the law. "They have shown nothing in their ranting and raving that shows any level of knowledge of where they would go or where they would take this," she said. She accused Republicans of pursuing a strategy of "repeal and delay" -- noting that it lacks even the GOP's "repeal and replace" alliteration and saying it "does nothing" and is "an act of cowardice."

Mark Shriver, head of Save the Children Action Network, expressed concerns with the policy priorities of the incoming Donald Trump administration - personal and corporate tax cuts, increases in defense spending, reductions in entitlements - and what it could mean for the vulnerable communities that have marginal influence in Washington. "They don't have political sway. They're not making big campaign contributions," Shriver told David Axelrod on "The Axe Files" podcast, produced by the University of Chicago Institute of Politics and CNN. "And when the cuts are made, they're the ones who don't have the biggest voice, and they're the most vulnerable." "Those first five years of life when 90% of brain growth happens, I think is the biggest social justice issue in this country," argued Shriver, because poor children are developing at a slower pace than more affluent children for want of resources and a proper learning environment. "It's outrageous that we don't do more as a country," Shriver continued. "I wish the leadership in Washington would see what's going on in the states and make a commitment to our poor kids before they enter kindergarten." During the conversation, Shriver touched on the personal impact that his parents - Sargent Shriver, the first director of the Peace Corps, and Eunice Kennedy Shriver, a driving force behind the Special Olympics - had on him. It was their Catholic faith and commitment to helping the poor and vulnerable that contributed to his decision to pursue a career in public service, Shriver says. While his commitment to public service never wavered, Shriver says that his faith underwent a test of confidence as he felt increasingly disconnected from the church of his youth and descended into what he called "a Catholic funk." Then Pope Francis began his papacy through very public and humble gestures of charity - asking for the blessing of the crowd at St. Peter's Square before he blessed them, washing the feet of juvenile offenders, even paying his own hotel bill. Shriver could see that this pope was different, but he wasn't certain if it was genuine. "These are all gestures that kind of clearly caught my attention and made me wonder, are these publicity stunts in order to garner positive PR for the church, or is this guy the real deal?" Shriver said. He was determined to find out. Driven by a need for greater understanding of the roots of Pope Francis's faith, and a desire to renew his own, Shriver set out to learn more about the new pope through his journey from Jesuit priest and reformist bishop in Buenos Aires to leader of the world's 1.2 billion Catholics, a remarkable path that he chronicles in his new book, "Pilgrimage: My Search for the Real Pope Francis." Shriver, answering emphatically that Pope Francis is indeed "the real deal," believes his power comes in part from his ability to challenge individuals to do their part to make our communities stronger and more compassionate. "I think that's why people respond to him," Shriver said. "Because great leadership, whether they're political or religious, ask us to get beyond our self... And they inspire us to go into our soul and to try to make connection with our neighbors. Not build walls and isolate us, right? And that's what great leaders do, and I think that's what he's doing." Whether Pope Francis, who is 80, can build a legacy strong enough to withstand the more traditional elements within the institutional arm of the Catholic Church, is a question Shriver cannot answer, but he is certain that the Pope has already left a lasting impact. "The way [Pope Francis] treats people on the fringes...he's sending a message to all of us," stated Shriver. "I think it's going to be hard to backtrack on that."

"North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U.S. It won't happen!" Trump tweeted. Trump quickly followed that up with a charge that China was doing nothing to help the US cope with the rogue nation. "China has been taking out massive amounts of money & wealth from the U.S. in totally one-sided trade, but won't help with North Korea. Nice!" Trump wrote. The President-elect launched his verbal missiles after the autocratic 32-year-old North Korean leader declared in a televised New Year's Day speech that his military is on the brink of testing its first intercontinental ballistic missile: a rocket that can be equipped with nuclear weapons and is powerful enough to reach any part of the US. A spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry responded Tuesday to Trump, saying, "China's efforts in resolving the North Korea nuclear issue have been obvious to all. Our contribution has been widely recognized by the international community. As the host of the six-nation talks, our efforts and achievements have been clear to all." Jeffrey Lewis, director of the "I think North Korea will probably test the KN-08 (intercontinental ballistic missile) this year, no matter what Trump tweets," he said in an email to CNN. While US officials and military experts doubt many of Kim's boasts,xc2xa0Trump may very well have to deal with an ICBM test and confront the danger Pyongyang poses to international stability. The hermit nation poses a unique threat. While the nuclear nations of China and Russia are both pushing back against US power across the globe, they are more integrated into the international system and neither is as erratic or threatening. This all moves Pyongyang to Trump's front burner as a simmering problem that might soon boil over. Kim declared Sunday that his goal was "to cope against the vicious threats for nuclear war by the Imperialists," a sinister nod to the US and its Asian allies. Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway was asked on "Good Morning America" on Tuesday what the President-elect intended to do to stop North Korea's nukes. "He's not stated that publicly, and he won't before he's inaugurated," Conway said. "But we do know that there are sanctions that are possible," she added. "They have not always worked. I think China would have to have a significant role here as well. But he's putting North Korea on notice through this tweet and other statements that this won't happen. He, as President of the United States, wants to stand between them and their missile capabilities, which experts say could be deployed to reach Seattle almost immediately." North Korea has been steadily working to improve its missile and weapons capability, conducting a fifth nuclear test in September. Americanxc2xa0analysts say there are still questions about Pyongyang's claims of technological advances -- particularly to key elements required to deliver a nuclear payload -- but the picture is still worrisome. "It's a very real and growing threat," said Bruce Klinger, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation. "Think Don Corleone, but with nuclear weapons."xc2xa0 North Korea might be easy to ridicule as "the funny little country, with the funny little guy, with the funny little hairstyle out of Jersey Shore," that can't even provide electricity to its people, Klingner said. But "North Korea is a multi-spectrum threat to the US, its allies and international peace and security." "This is the worst regime in the world trying to acquire the worst weapons in the world and the means to reach the US with them," Victor Cha, a senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said of North Korea.xc2xa0"In terms of a direct threat to American security, this is it."xc2xa0 He said that threat is different than that from major powers Russia and China. "With Russia and China, we're mutually deterred" because of nuclear capabilities, he explained. "With North Korea, you just don't know what this guy is going to do." Pyongyang has a million-man army poised along the border with South Korea, where US forces are based. The state engages in massive counterfeiting operations of the US $100 bill and in the manufacturing of methamphetamine. US security officials place it in the top five cyber threats worldwide. It has an estimated 16 to 20 nuclear weapons and is steadily working to miniaturize them and improve the range and accuracy ofxc2xa0missiles to deliver them. North Korea's new boast about an ICBM that could deliver those weapons to the USxc2xa0comes as Washington is undergoing a leadership transition -- always a fragile time -- and Kim sees 2017 as "an opportune time" to complete development of a nuclear weapon because of these leadership challenges, according to a high-level North Korean diplomat who recently defected to South Korea. Kim is "determined" to complete development of a nuclear weapon by the end of 2017, the diplomat said at a December press briefing, according to Yonhap news agency.xc2xa0 "This is not just saber-rattling to get attention," Cha said. "This is an actual military goal they're seeking." And they'rexc2xa0well on their way, despite repeated international attempts over decades to slow Pyongyang's program through sanctions and diplomacy. North Korea conducted an unprecedented number of missile tests in 2016 and a satellite launch that experts call a sign that it has cleared significant hurdles toward ICBM technology.xc2xa0 It has already notched other potentially lethal successes.xc2xa0 Pyongyang fired a submarine-based ballistic missile in August, a weapon that South Korea has no viable defense against, said Klingner, a former chief of the CIA's Korea branch.xc2xa0After the test, the South Korean Defense Ministry revised its estimate on the North's ability to deploy submarine-launched missiles from around four years to as little as a year.xc2xa0 The country likely already has working nuclear warheads for its Nodong medium-range ballistic missile, which threatens all of South Korea and Japan, experts say. And Pyongyang's intermediate range missile, the Musudan, can hit Guam, the location of a major US military base and a critical node in the defense of the western Pacific Ocean. It isn't clear whether North Korea has the ability to put a nuclear warhead on the Musudan yet. The ICBM would be the next level up, putting the continental US within Pyongyang's deadly reach. US four-star generals, including Gen. Vincent Brooks, who leads US forces in South Korea, and Adm. Harry Harris, head of US Pacific Command, say North Korea is nearing that capability. Other experts don't think Pyongyang is quite there yet, but say it likely will be within Trump's first term. Bruce Bennett, axc2xa0a senior defense analyst at the Rand Corporation, says that despite North Korea's apparent progress on a warhead, it doesn't yet have good enough missile and rocket technology to deliver a nuke. A key question is whether they have the technology that would allow the missiles to re-enter the atmosphere. North Koreans have this capability for the intermediate range Musudan missile, which can hit South Korea and Japan. It's a harder technological feat to achieve re-entry capability for an ICBM, which is subject to higher temperatures and greater velocities. For now, US military officials told CNN that they assess that North Korea still hasn't mastered that technology or key elements of firing and fuzing a weapon. xc2xa0 "They're likely further along than many experts and pundits give them credit for," according to Klingner. "We may not know where they are on that path, but we know they're on it." xc2xa0Kim boasted in his New Year's remarks that his country has successfully tested a variety of ICBM technologies. "Research and development of the cutting-edge tech weapons are actively progressing and strengthening our defense capabilities, including last-stage preparation of tests for intercontinental ballistic rocket launch have been continuously succeeding," he declared. If the young leader goes ahead, an ICBMxc2xa0test would be a flagrant violation of numerous United Nations resolutions and beg a response from Trump. The President-elect has called Kim a "maniac," but has also said he would sit down and negotiate with him, a break from long-standing international norms. xc2xa0A test would also deepen worries in South Korea and Japan, already rattled by suggestions from candidate Trump that the US should cover less of their defense and,xc2xa0 in another violation of international norms, that they should develop their own nuclear programs.xc2xa0 And it would immediately increase tensions between the US and North Korea's closest ally China, which Trump has suggested has "total control" over Pyongyang. If China won't rein North Korea in, Trump has suggested the US should "make trade very difficult" with Beijing. He has also suggested that he would have China assassinate the North Korean leader to make him "disappear in one form or another very quickly."xc2xa0 Cha said the decision to stop North Korea from reaching the point where it could deter the US by threatening Honolulu or Los Angeles with destruction will be a personal one that the President-elect will likely have to make. While some experts estimate Pyongyang will have an ICBM by 2020, Cha thinks it will be sooner. "If the President decides this can't stand, then all kinds of options open up for him" to take action, Cha said, including significant shifts in the US force posture in Asia and exerting greater pressure on China.

If carried through, the threat that could delay confirming the President-elect's choices for months. Those targeted include secretary of state nominee Democrats warn if they don't get the nominees' required background information and financial records and have adequate time to review them before confirmation hearings are held, they'll drag out confirmation votes with a series of procedural maneuvers. While Democrats are unlikely to have the votes to block most of these nominees, their threat to delay the confirmation process of Trump's Cabinet could hamper the new administration, which has promised a fast start in undoing policies of outgoing President Barack Obama. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell plans confirmation votes on multiple nominees on the afternoon of Inauguration Day, something that could now be in jeopardy if Democrats carry out their threat of imposing procedural hurdles. However, Republicans said they weren't convinced the delaying tactics from incoming Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer would succeed. Any "attempt by Republicans to have a series of rushed, truncated hearings before Inauguration Day and before the Congress and public have adequate information on all of them is something Democrats will vehemently resist," Schumer said in a written statement. "If Republicans think they can quickly jam through a whole slate of nominees without a fair hearing process, they're sorely mistaken." Tillerson, the ExxonMobil chief executive who has been criticized by Republicans and Democrats for his ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, has drawn additional scrutiny from Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for not turning in his tax returns for the past three years, something Republicans argue is not required of him. Sessions has also been blasted by Democrats on the Judiciary Committee for turning in what they say is incomplete background information from the Alabama senator. The other six nominees targeted by Democrats: Rep. Confirmation hearings for Sessions, Tillerson, DeVos and Pudzer are tentatively scheduled to begin next week. Once the committees have voted to send the nominations to the floor, Democrats, who have 48 seats compared to 52 for Republicans, can force delays for up to about one week per nominee, meaning it could take months to get through all the major posts. But without GOP support, Democrats will be unable to use the ultimate stopping power of the filibuster to block nominees they oppose because in the last Congress they changed Senate rules -- over the objection of Republicans -- to lower the threshold of votes to overcome a filibuster of executive branch nominees from 60 to 51. That means they best they can do is use procedural delays to stall a final confirmation vote. They can insist on cloture votes for each nominee, and then use the entire amount of debate time allowed under the rules to delay speedy votes, and clog up floor time with lengthy floor speeches. This would mean each nominee could take up to a week to ultimately be confirmed and force McConnell to set aside other top legislative priorities -- like starting the process of repealing Obamacare. Republicans also think the handful of Democrats from red-leaning states who are up for re-election in 2018 won't be willing to obstruct Trump's nominees. "When President Obama was elected, Republicans and Democrats worked together and expeditiously to carefully consider his nominees. The Senate held hearings on multiple nominees before he was even sworn in. The Senate confirmed seven of his nominees on day one-and nearly all were confirmed within two weeks," said Don Stewart, a spokesman for McConnell. "Sen. Schumer and others approved wholeheartedly of this approach at the time, so surely they won't object to treating the incoming president's nominees with the same courtesy and seriousness with which the Senate acted on President Obama's nominees." Democrats say that Obama's nominees were vetted earlier by the FBI and the Office of Government Ethics, which reviews potential financial conflicts by nominees, and that those results were turned over to the committee before the confirmation hearings were scheduled. Republicans note, however, that none of the confirmation hearings has been officially scheduled and that only tentative dates have been announced.

Experts say that the unusually high number of vacancies -- due in part to judicial warfare between the Obama administration and the Republican-led Senate -- could change the face of the courts. "If President-elect Trump can put a different face on the Supreme Court and the Courts of Appeals he could substantially change the course of federal jurisprudence," said Russell Wheeler of the Brookings Institution. As things stand now, there are 103 vacancies in the appeals and district courts. The Administrative Office of the US Courts defines 38 of those as judicial "emergencies," or those where vacancies have existed for an extended period of time in areas with a high number of filings. For comparison, President Barack Obama had 59 vacancies when he took office. A shift in the courts could impact hot-button issues such as abortion, gun control, environmental protection and transgender rights. To be sure, the current vacancies include seats that had been held by judges who were originally nominated by Republican presidents. It's also true that a nominee doesn't always fulfill the vision of the person who places him on the bench. But the large number gives Trump and unusual opportunity to make his mark on the judiciary. "Republicans in the 114th Senate confirmed an abnormally low number of judges creating an abnormally high number of vacancies for Trump to fill," said Wheeler. Although critics say that Obama was slow out of the gate in filling seats early in his tenure, by the end of his administration he had appointed 323 district and circuit court judges, according to Wheeler, slightly more than George W. Bush. But he was also President when the Senate changed the rules. Frustrated by Republican efforts to block nominees, the Democrats triggered the so called "nuclear option, which allowed the President's judicial and executive nominees to be confirmed with only 51 votes. Supreme Court nominees are exempt from the change and still subject to the 60-vote threshold. Perhaps the impact of the rules change was most evident on the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. After the "nuclear option" eliminating the Senate filibuster, Obama pushed through three more nominees on that court which is often called the "second most important court in the land" because it reviews actions by federal agencies. "Republicans resisted filling vacant seats on the Court of Appeals, arguing that the court didn't need the judges. That was the straw that broke the camel's back and led the Democrats to change the filibuster rules and shortly thereafter the Senate confirmed three pending nominees," said Wheeler. Trump's task will be complicated by the fact that Senate leaders usually honor a long-standing rule that home state senators of either party must approve a nominee before they process it.

"This report that everyone keeps talking about is not final," Spicer said, speaking on CNN's "New Day." The "intelligence community is talking about wrapping it up later this week ... the idea that we are jumping to conclusions before we have a final report is frankly irresponsible." Over the weekend, Trump voiced doubt over the pending report, invoking flawed intelligence from the lead-up to the Iraq War and suggesting someone else could be to blame for the hacks. He also claimed to have inside information on the matter, which he said he would reveal later this week. "I just want them to be sure, because it's a pretty serious charge, and I want them to be sure," said Trump, speaking from his Mar-a-Lago estate. "And if you look at the weapons of mass destruction, that was a disaster, and they were wrong." Trump Spicer continued to defend those comments Monday. "As President-elect he is privy to information most people aren't," Spicer said. Camerota continued to question Spicer on the level of information Trump has received so far from the intelligence community. "He has not been briefed about the heads of the intelligence community about whether or not they believe Russia is behind the hacking?" she asked. Spicer said he had not but that officials were set to brief Trump later in the week, once the report was finalized. "The idea we're asking people and making assumptions on a report that's not final is unbelievable," he added. Later in the exchange, Spicer also took a shot at Camerota, suggesting she was unable to see the good sense in Trump's approach to the alleged hacks. "I know this frustrating for you that we're doing it in a logical way," Spicer said. "No, we're going to get all the information, get briefed properly and then make a decision. We're not going to put the cart before the horse." But US officials told CNN later Monday that the "digital fingerprints" indicating that Russia orchestrated the cyberhacks around the US election give the intelligence community growing confidence in its Oct 7 public assessment that Russia carried out the hacking. One US official said that the hacks were perpetrated on specific Cyrillic keyboards. The intelligence community is confident in their analysis, citing the extremely high quality intelligence on Russia. As one official put it, "This is not a black hole like North Korea." ©Sen. Chuck Schumer, the incoming Democratic Senate leader, said Tuesday that President-elect Donald Trump told him he liked him more than Republican leaders in Congress. But the New York Democrat told CNN's Dana Bash he would remain skeptical of Trump's effort to "flatter" him. "When you get to be in my position, people do tend to want to flatter you and you've got to take it with a grain of salt," Schumer said. The New York Post Asked by Bash about the report, Schumer acknowledged, "He said something close to it." Despite the kind words, Schumer said that will not influence his approach to policymaking in the upcoming session. "Look, I don't know Donald Trump very well. I never played golf with him, I never had a meal with him. I'd cross his path at things in New York. But that's going to have very little effect," he said. "My guiding light is going to be the principles of our party and what I think are the right principles of our country: helping the middle class, helping those trying to get there." Schumer was a part of a group of lawmakers Schumer was a part of a group of lawmakers ©Chuck Schumer arrived for his first day as Senate Democratic leader to a large, new Capitol suite still strewn with unpacked boxes. "It's a little fancier than I'm used to, but it goes with the territory," Schumer told us, as he sat down for his maiden television interview as the Senate's top Democrat. Schumer was hoping to be the new Democratic Senate majority leader, working with Hillary Clinton in the White House. Instead, he is leading the Trump opposition. The former would have been more fun, he conceded, but he says being minority leader now is "more important." Here's how he described a recent phone conversation with Donald Trump: "I said, 'Mr. President-elect, you went after both the Democratic and Republican establishments when you ran; you were an anti-establishment change candidate. But by your Cabinet picks and your early pronouncements, you seem to be embracing your timeworn, shop-worn hard right,'" he recalled. "If you do that, your presidency will not come close to being a success," he told Trump. For Schumer, success will be even more complicated. He has to walk a very fine line between when to work with Trump, and when to oppose him. Schumer describes it as "accountability." "The only way we're going to work with him is if he moves completely in our direction and abandons his Republican colleagues," Schumer said. "90-95% of the time, we'll be holding his feet to the fire, holding him accountable. But we're Democrats, we're not going to just oppose things to oppose them," he added. Schumer started his congressional career in the House in 1981, and served there until successfully defeating longtime Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato in 1998. He climbed the Democratic ranks as a fierce partisan and prolific fundraiser, but in recent years turned his attention to also becoming a successful legislator who can work across the aisle. He played a key role in crafting bipartisan Senate immigration reform in 2013, though the bill stalled in the House and never became law. Schumer loves being the center of deal making, a lot like the incoming president. "Well, here's the problem. The Republicans in the Senate and the House have been run by a hard right group," said Schumer. But what about now that they have a dealmaker in the White House? "Look, we're going to look at the specifics," Schumer said. "And on the overwhelming bunch of it, particularly given who he's chosen as his Cabinet people, we're going to have to oppose him because we just disagree in principle." "Of course I'd like to make a deal," he added. Many progressives scoff at the notion of Schumer even considering any form of compromise with Trump. Democracy for America, a leading progressive group, said: "Democratic leaders from Chuck Schumer down need to stop playing footsie with Trump and pretending we can find." Schumer's response: "We're playing no footsie. My views are exactly the same as Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders." "If we can work with him and be true to our principles, we're not going to reject him. But overall, we're sticking to our principles," he said. The two New Yorkers have a history. Schumer says he doesn't know Trump well, but he was one Schumer's of early political donors. Schumer confirmed New York Post reporting that the President-elect told him he likes him better than GOP leaders. The new Democratic leader said he wasn't surprised, but also not flattered. "When you get to be in my position, people do tend to want to flatter you and you've got to take it with a grain of salt," he said. Trump is hardly Schumer's only concern. He's also going to be the de facto leader of the movement to fix the defeated Democratic Party. "What we have to do is look at this election in the eye and see what we did wrong. I think we know what we did wrong. We have always been a party with a sharp-edged economic message that talks about helping the middle class and people who want to get to the middle class get there more easily. We didn't have that in this election," Schumer said. "So that even though Trump's positions were much further away from where the middle class is and what they want, he seemed to be the person talking to them." The New York Democrat says he will help his party craft what he calls a "focused and sharp-edged message." "And here's the good news. Some people say, 'Which direction do you go in? The old Obama coalition or the new blue collar?' If we have a sharp-edged economic message, it unites our party. It unites Joe Manchin (a West Virginia moderate) to Bernie Sanders (a Vermont liberal), both of whom are on my leadership team," Schumer said. "It unites the blue-collar worker in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the college student paying her loans in Los Angeles, the single mom in Harlem who's on minimum wage," he said, seeming to take the message for a test-drive. It may be just the task for the man who put himself on the political map in the1980s by being media savvy. It was then that he realized that Sundays were a great day to make news (especially the New York Times), so he started holding regular Sunday news conferences. In the 1990s, one of the running jokes in Washington was that the most dangerous place in to be in the District was between Schumer and a television camera (Schumer says it was originally former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole's line after Schumer used his publicity prowess to push through the Brady gun law). But that's no longer true. Over the past several years, Schumer has tried to be more disciplined. He's more likely to either be on his cell phone in the Capitol hallways, or pretend to be, in order to avoid talking to reporters "In the early days, the press was a very good way to bring out problems that needed to be fixed. Now, I have other levers of power, so I'm hardly inaccessible. And you can say a lot of bad things about Chuck Schumer and accessibility is never going to be one of them," Schumer said with a knowing laugh. The same goes for authenticity. Though he proudly declared that he bought a new suit for his first day as leader, he is clearly still the same rumpled guy who slept for 30-plus years on a mattress next to the kitchen in a rundown group house owned by former Rep. George Miller. He now lives in an apartment, which is why he told us he is excited to have a large balcony outside his Capitol office. "We're going to try to find out if we can have barbeques," Schumer said with genuine excitement. After a few more minutes, the New Yorker told us he had to get back to work. After all, he laughed, he can't spend all his time doing press. After a few more minutes, the New Yorker told us he had to get back to work.

"We continue to benefit as a country from the contributions of those young people who have come forward and want nothing more than to contribute to our country and our shared future." Johnson said it is department precedent to only use the details of people seeking protection from deportation only for that express purpose, citing how foreign victims of Hurricane Katrina or abused immigrants under the jurisdiction of the Violence Against Women Act were treated. "We believe these representations made by the US government, upon which DACA applicants most assuredly relied, must continue to be honored," Johnson wrote.

Trump suggested that intelligence officials postponed an " 'intelligence' briefing on so-called 'Russian hacking' " that they were set to deliver to him this week because they might need more time "to build a case." He called the alleged delay "very strange." Trump Trump said last week that he would receive an intelligence briefing on the Russian breaches this week and suggested it would come early on, telling reporters on New Year's Eve that they would know more about the subject "Tuesday or Wednesday." But US intelligence officials disputed Trump's tweet alleging a delay. Top US intelligence officials have been scheduled to brief Trump on the full report on Russian hacking President Barack Obama ordered once it was completed, but the meeting was not set to take place until later in the week, according to US officials. The meeting was never scheduled for Tuesday, as even Obama has yet to receive the full-fledged briefing on the Russian hacking, one US official said. And a US intelligence official told CNN that Director of National Intelligence James Clapper was never scheduled to be in New York City, where Trump is, on Tuesday -- and was perplexed about the "delay" Trump claimed was taking place. Trump on Tuesday did receive a classified intelligence briefing -- the Presidential Daily Briefing -- which Trump has elected to receive only sporadically. But it did not dive deeply into the Russian hacking. US officials briefed on the matter said Clapper, National Security Agency Director Adm. Mike Rogers, FBI Director James Comey and CIA Director John Brennan are scheduled to attend the meeting with Trump providing him details on the Russian hacking. While Obama met with the heads of US intelligence agencies in his first weeks as president-elect, Trump has yet to do so eight weeks after he was elected, which US officials said was due to Trump's scheduling conflicts. Instead, the President-elect has repeatedly questioned their assessment of Russian cyber activity. Before the election, when 17 US intelligence agencies issued a public statement concluding that Russia orchestrated the hack of the Democratic National Committee, Trump immediately cast doubt on those conclusions, arguing it was impossible to distinguish between a Russian government operative and "somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds." After Obama then slapped a series of sanctions on Russia, Trump issued a statement calling for the country to "move on to bigger and better things" and then tweeted praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin for not retaliating against the sanctions. Trump continued his skepticism on New Year's Eve, telling reporters once again that it "could be somebody else." "I know a lot about hacking. And hacking is a very hard thing to prove," he said. He added that he also knows "things that other people don't know, so they can't be sure of the situation." On Tuesday, Reacting to a US intelligence official who told CNN the administration traced the hack to specific keyboards, which featured Cyrillic characters, Kremlin spokesman Dimitri Peskov said: "I don't understand what this means exactly but Cyrillic characters can be used everywhere." "Once again I reject any possibility that official Russia can be involved in any way," he added. In December, In December, ©A new video raises questions about President-elect Donald Trump's relationship with Joseph "Joey No Socks" Cinque, who once reportedly survived a mob hit and was associated with the infamous mob boss John Gotti. The video shows Trump ringing in the new year on stage with Cinque at his Mar-a-Lago hotel in Palm Beach, Florida. The Secret Service told CNN everyone who attended the party was subject to screening via a metal detector. Cinque was convicted in 1989 of criminal possession of stolen art, a felony. He was sentenced to "conditional discharge" in 1990, according to records provided by a New York Supreme Court clerk. CNN was told the actual indictment was destroyed in a fire. Cinque did not serve jail time. While there is no record of how long the conditional discharge sentence lasted, a lack of further court records in the case indicates that he did not violate the discharge, the clerk told CNN. In a 1995 profile in New York magazine, Cinque is the president and CEO of the American Academy of Hospitality Services, an organization that over the years has listed Trump as "ambassador extraordinaire." His children also served as honorary trustees on the board, which is made up of several Trump friends and business associates. In 2013, the Academy awarded Trump a Cinque has made numerous appearances with the Trump family. In February 2009, Cinque and the President-elect appeared together in a promotional video for the Academy where Trump said, "I'd especially like to congratulate and thank Joe Cinque, the head of the academy, for the unbelievable job that he does. There's nobody like him. He's a special guy. There's just nobody close." Reached for comment, Trump's transition team told CNN, "Mr. Trump never denied knowing Mr. Cinque." Donald Trump Jr., one of Trump's adult sons, and Cinque Andy Langsam, Cinque's attorney, said that Trump has a "business relationship" with the Academy and Cinque. "The PEOTUS owned and controlled (now his Organization and children) fabulously run, beautiful and highly qualified properties that definitely are well deserving of the recognition provided by The American Academy of Hospitality Sciences," he told CNN. "That doesn't mean anyone at The Academy knows on any personal basis the recipient's CEO, CFO, Officers, Directors or General or Limited partner(s) and to suggest otherwise is wrong." ©Donald Trump isn't even in Washington yet, but he's already throwing his weight around. The President-elect prevailed Tuesday in the first exchange of what could turn out to be an awkward, sometimes turbulent relationship with fellow Republicans on Capitol Hill. A full-blown PR disaster threatened to derail the first day of the new Congress as House Republicans prepared to move forward with a measure that would have gutted an independent ethics office. As the scope of the controversy became clear by mid-morning, Trump threw cold water on the plan, calling the ethics watchdog "unfair," but suggesting there were bigger priorities for lawmakers to tackle. "With all that Congress has to work on, do they really have to make the weakening of the Independent Ethics Watchdog, as unfair as it ... may be, their number one act and priority," Trump said in consecutive tweets. "Focus on tax reform, healthcare and so many other things of far greater importance!" Within hours, House GOP lawmakers met in an emergency session and Either way, it's certain the blowback intensified to a new level once Trump turned to Twitter. Rep. Steve King of Iowa, who backed the attempt to gut the ethics panel that many lawmakers believe overreaches, said Trump's comment "animated the press" and created pressure on GOP lawmakers to change course. "I'm concerned that now we have Republicans criticizing Republicans," King said. "We need to stay away from that." Some lawmakers said they decided independently their move was unwise and didn't need Trump to tell them. But in a sense, it does not matter. The perception quickly jelled in Washington that Trump put himself at the center of the storm and changed the weather. Such actions tend to enhance a President's perceived power, especially in the crucial early months of his administration. The GOP wrangle was not Trump's only win on Tuesday. Ford announced it would nix a plan to build a factory in Mexico and would spend $700 million to bring 700 jobs to Michigan, crediting Trump's policies for the move. Democrats will argue that such interventions pale into comparison to the millions of jobs created by President Barack Obama. But Trump faces the likely impossible challenge of returning US manufacturing jobs from low-wage economies abroad. So in the case of Ford, as with the spat on Capitol Hill, the symbolism and media coverage is far more important than context. In the meantime, Tuesday's drama offered a preview of how Trump will govern. The Twitter president appears unlikely to be content with working congressional back channels and using conventional levers of power to get his way. The day's events also showed that while Trump may be a Washington newbie, he knows how to score an easy political win. For much of his transition, Trump has been hounded by ethics questions of his own, centering on potential huge conflicts of interests posed by his global business interests. His wealthy cabinet picks -- such as Rex Tillerson for secretary of state and Steve Mnuchin for Treasury -- are being accused by Democrats of failing to provide sufficient financial data and other information ahead of their confirmation hearings. But Trump can now present himself as a champion of ethical standards on Capitol Hill and argue that he has already taken a step to honor his vow of draining Washington's political swamp. The exchange also appeared to hint at the Republican hierarchy in Washington after the inauguration and the incoming president's relationship with Speaker Paul Ryan. Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, initially opposed the change to ethics rules. But once he was defied by his troops, he fell into line, issuing a statement defending the move -- only for GOP lawmakers to reverse themselves later. The way the confrontation ended left an impression that Trump, basking in the political capital that new presidents enjoy, may have as much sway with the restive Republican caucus as Ryan himself, who was re-elected speaker on Tuesday. Of course, life is going to get a lot tougher for the President-elect. Despite their common political aims -- repealing Obamacare, passing big tax cuts and beginning a new era of conservative rule -- Trump and the GOP will not always see eye to eye. And Ryan's new GOP conference looks as likely to be as unruly as his last one. Washington's set up of competing branches of government will also open rifts, as will GOP divisions on issues like infrastructure spending and saving entitlements where Trump parts company with Republican orthodoxy. And a clash is already brewing between the President-elect and Republicans over Trump's determination to improve ties with Russia. Sen. John McCain, a Russia hawk who is demanding new sanctions against the Kremlin over the alleged attempt to intervene in November's election, plans to convene a Senate Armed Services hearing on cyber-security this week that could cause tension with the incoming administration. But the overwhelming effect of Tuesday's back-and-forth was to underline that a new political era has dawned. In an interview with CNN's Dana Bash, newly-elected Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he was ready to work with Trump -- but wasn't holding his breath. "The only way we're going to work with him is if he moves completely in our direction and abandons his Republican colleagues," Schumer said. "That's not going to happen very often." The sense of shifting eras was also evident in the absence of the dominant figure who has commanded the spotlight in Washington for so long - Obama. The President stayed out of sight Tuesday, a day after returning for his Hawaiian vacation. The White House has repeatedly stressed that the US only has one president at a time -- a line White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest repeated Tuesday after Trump warned the current administration to drop plans to transfer more prisoners from Guantanamo Bay before Obama leaves office. Asked whether Trump's move will change the President's mind, Earnest replied "No, it will not," before adding: "He'll have an opportunity to implement the policy that he believes will be more effective when he takes office on January 20." ©Former President Bill Clinton and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton will attend President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration later this month, aides to both Clintons told CNN on Tuesday. Former President George W. Bush and former first lady Laura Bush will also attend, the 43rd president's office said in a statement Tuesday. "President and Mrs. George W. Bush will attend the 58th Presidential Inauguration Ceremony on January 20, 2017, at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C.," the statement read. "They are pleased to be able to witness the peaceful transfer of power -- a hallmark of American democracy -- and swearing-in of President Trump and Vice President Pence." Previously, Jimmy Carter was the only former commander in chief who had publicly said he would attend Trump's inauguration. Bush's father, President George H.W. Bush, will not be attending due to his health, a spokesman has told CNN. Former presidents traditionally attend the ceremonial transfer of power at the US Capitol. Despite being a fellow Republican, Bush did not vote for Trump on Election Day, a decision Trump later deemed "sad." Bush's father voted for Hillary Clinton, according to sources. During the primaries, both Bushes supported their family member, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who was a fierce challenger of Trump's. On Thursday, Kristy Campbell, a spokeswoman for Jeb Bush, said he wouldn't be attending the inauguration. Just a week after the election, George W. Bush "I understand anger, and some people may have been angry when I was president. But anger shouldn't drive policy," Bush said in Dallas in a rare public speech. "What needs to drive policy is what's best for the people who are angry." "I understand anger, and some people may have been angry when I was president. But anger shouldn't drive policy," Bush said in Dallas in a rare public speech.

"I would expect, at this point, additional transfers to be announced," said Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary. He characterized the moves, which come in the final weeks of Obama's administration, as continuing the long-running effort to clear detainees from the prison. Earlier Tuesday, Trump revived the hot-button topic of the prison facility at Guantanamo Bay, also known as Gitmo, in a Twitter message warning against further prisoner transfers before he takes office. "There should be no further releases from Gitmo. These are extremely dangerous people and should not be allowed back onto the battlefield," Trump tweeted Tuesday. Earnest said Obama would not factor Trump's tweet into his decision-making on the prison. Trump, he said, would have "an opportunity to implement the policy that he believes will be more effective when he takes office on January 20." Trump's message, consistent with his campaign promise to keep the facility open and even increase the number of detainees, came shortly after the President-elect criticized House Republicans for prioritizing a vote to gut Congress' independent ethics panel over other important issues, causing the House GOP to back down on the change. "With all that Congress has to work on, do they really have to make the weakening of the Independent Ethics Watchdog, as unfair as it ... may be, their number one act and priority," Trump tweeted. "Focus on tax reform, healthcare and so many other things of far greater importance! #DTS." Trump particularly criticized the timing of the vote, which was scheduled for the first day of the new congressional session. Trump's tweet on Guantanamo also followed news last month that Obama was trying to leave as few prisoners there as possible, notifying Congress that the administration intends to transfer out some of the detainees before Trump is sworn in. In While some detainees have returned to the battlefield, they are released to host countries who agree to take them. The idea is that the host country keeps an eye on those released detainees so they don't return to terrorism, but there's no guarantee of success. Peter Cook, the Pentagon's press secretary, said in response to Trump's tweet that the department would follow the "appropriate policies" set forth by Obama. "We're going to carry out the appropriate policies as set forth by the commander in chief with regard to Guantanamo Bay and the secretary of defense," Cook said at a press briefing. The secretary of defense "is going to continue to carry out his responsibilities as appropriate until he's finished as secretary of defense," Cook added. ©Democrats on the Hill -- including Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts -- are speaking out against Republicans' push to limit the powers of a watchdog panel that polices the ethics of Congress, saying it's "absolutely ridiculous." "They completely blindsided us. It's absolutely ridiculous," Moulton told CNN's Alisyn Camerota Tuesday on "New Day." "Is there any American out there who thinks Congress is too ethical?" "Donald Trump and the Republicans said they're going to drain the swamp, and the very first thing they do is dismantle our outside ethics watchdog." House Republicans voted 119-74 Monday in a closed-door meeting to gut Congress' independent watchdog. The full House will vote on the rules later Tuesday. Virginia Rep. Bob Goodlatte's proposal would place the independent Office of Congressional Ethics under the control of lawmakers, which outraged Democrats and outside ethics organizations. Republicans argued that the ethics office was too powerful, aggressive and overzealous and at times took away individuals' due process. But Moulton doubted that those were the real motivations behind the GOP's decision. "I guess what they have on their agenda might run into trouble with ethics. I don't know what else could be the reason," he said. Despite Republicans being in the majority, Moulton is optimistic that he will be able to find common ground with conservatives who value accountability. "The good news on things like this is that there are Republicans who oppose it," he said. "Even Speaker Paul Ryan opposes this change." Rep. Dan Kildee, a Michigan Democrat, said Republicans had campaigned on planning to close the ethics office, the election outcome may have looked different. "It was dishonest of them to do this in the middle of the night and to try bring it up without any debate at all. And unfortunately it looks like this will probably pass." But the Michigan Democrat said his party will not allow this to move forward without a fight. "This is not over. We're not going to just say, 'Oh, we lost this one,'" he said. "The American people are going to weigh in on this and they may have to make a change." But Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn said that the vote doesn't close the office entirely. "It doesn't kill the Office of Congressional Ethics," she told Camerota. "What it does is to bring it under the jurisdiction or the oversight, if you will, (of) the Committee on Ethics." "It provides individuals with the opportunity to have some due recourse and to know who is accusing them, which is not something that individuals have known," the Tennessee lawmaker said. Blackburn said she hopes the move will make ethics investigations more open. "My hope is what you will see is more transparency," Blackburn added. "You will see individuals with the opportunity to know who is accusing them and we will see matters resolved in a more timely manner." The vice chair of Trump's transition team dismissed the idea that the decision was made "in the middle of the night." "This is the time that the conferences meet," Blackburn said. "It's a matter of timing." "Most people would say that five in the afternoon is not at night," she said. "And the Democrats have their meetings behind closed doors also." "Most people would say that five in the afternoon is not at night," she said. "And the Democrats have their meetings behind closed doors also." ©On the eve of the 115th Congress, as Republicans prepared for the first time in a decade to assume almost unfettered control of the federal government, the House GOP voted in a closed-door meeting to decimate the chamber's independent nonpartisan oversight office. Their "reform" effort would be short-lived, as a torrent of outrage and bipartisan backlash undercut the controversial amendment, which in less than a day managed to split Republicans, fuel Democratic resistance and put an early blemish on the GOP majority. The plan would be scrapped before noon, In a closed door, private meeting Monday night, the House Republican rank-and-file voted to cut the legs out from the ethics panel, an independent watchdog group created in 2008 under then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi following a series of high-profile, embarrassing scandals. The new proposal would have placed the office under the heel of the House Ethics Committee, the same body to which it had delivered reports and findings for the past eight years. It would have been banned from accepting anonymous tips -- silencing many potential whistleblowers -- and been barred from communicating to the public. The reasoning? Republicans (and some Democrats in the past) had complained that panel's reports, which usually contained allegations of ethical or criminal wrongdoing, were made public without sufficient avenues of redress for the accused. House Democrats pounced as news organizations reported the unexpected and mysterious vote. But the verdict was nearly uniform, even crossing traditional partisan lines. "Republicans claim they want to 'drain the swamp,' but the night before the new Congress gets sworn in, the House GOP has eliminated the only independent ethics oversight of their actions," Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement. Anne Caprara, executive director at Priorities USA, a pro-Democratic super PAC, On the right, Judicial Watch, the conservative group that has hounded Democrats for years, weighed in with a note of disapproval earlier in the night. "Poor way to begin draining the swamp, @SpeakerRyan," its president, Tom Fitton, tweeted. By Tuesday morning, the group had called the House GOP's vote a "shameful" move to The author of the proposal, Virginia Rep. Bob Goodlatte, came to its defense hours later, pushing back on reports that his amendment would undermine the ethics panel's mission. "There should be no entity in the entire federal government that doesn't have review by some committee of the Congress so that's all it sets up is oversight," he told CNN. "It still has its designated statutory responsibilities." Word emerged late Monday that House Speaker Paul Ryan and his top deputy, Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, had urged their caucus to back down before the vote, with an aide close to Ryan familiar with the discussions telling CNN on Tuesday the speaker had been "against the amendment and opposed it throughout." But early Tuesday morning, a top Trump adviser seemed to publicly back the move. "If a constituent has a complaint, they can still lodge that complaint," Kellyanne Conway told NBC's "Today" show. "They just can't do it anonymously. And many of these people -- members and their staffers who have been under investigation -- they have complained about their due process rights being violated and compromised. They need protections, as well." But, as she herself noted, Conway had not yet spoken to Trump about the issue. At a little after 10 a.m. ET, the President-elect joined the chorus. "With all that Congress has to work on, do they really have to make the weakening of the Independent Ethics Watchdog, as unfair as it ... may be, their number one act and priority," he said in a pair of tweets. "Focus on tax reform, healthcare and so many other things of far greater importance!" -- adding #DTS, a hashtag signifying his campaign promise to "drain the swamp." If the floor was already falling out, the Trump tweet caved in the ceilings. Ryan sought to limit the damage while saving face with his caucus, issuing a statement shortly thereafter that sought to cast the "reform" effort in a better light. "After eight years of operation, many members believe the Office of Congressional Ethics is in need of reform to protect due process and ensure it is operating according to its stated mission," he said in a statement. "I want to make clear that this House will hold its members to the highest ethical standards and the office will continue to operate independently to provide public accountability to Congress." But by late morning, House Republicans were huddling in private again and a littler after noon, the reversal of the reversal was complete: The amendment had been shelved and the Office of Congressional Ethics would -- for now, at least -- carry on its mission. As senior Republicans do their best to push ahead and leave this episode behind, Goodlatte blamed "gross misrepresentation by opponents of my amendment, and the media willing to go along with this agenda" for scuttling his efforts. On the Democratic side, Pelosi sought to yoke the GOP to the controversy. "House Republicans showed their true colors last night, and reversing their plans to destroy the Office of Congressional Ethics will not obscure their clear contempt for ethics in the People's House," she said in a statement, lauding "the strength of public outrage" that stoked a swift and brutal backlash.

The resolution passed, 234-193, after House Republicans were forced to drop a provision that would have gutted the independent ethics panel tasked with investigating potential rules violations. The language, included in a closed-door session Monday night, was dropped after criticism from President-elect Donald Trump and intense blowback from their own constituents. The new rules package includes a Republican provision to impose fines on any House member who violates the decorum rules of the House. That change was added in response to a Democratic-led sit-in that tied up the House floor in June for over 24 hours, when dozens of members took over the chamber and demanded action on gun control measures. The proposal doesn't slap any financial penalty on specific members for that episode, but going forward a member could face a $500 penalty for breaking the rules governing debate, and an additional $2,500 fine for each additional offense. Georgia Democratic Rep John Lewis, a leader of the civil rights movement who led the sit-in angrily denounced the proposal on Tuesday and vowed to continue to press for votes on gun-related bills. "No Congress, nobody, no committee has the power to tell us that we cannot stand up, speak up and speak truth to power. We have a right to dissent," Lewis loudly argued on the House floor, adding, "we cannot and will not be silent." Republicans say that it's important to preserve the rules and that if they fail to punish those who break them then it's unfair to the entire chamber, which is charged with moving legislation. "Decorum comes with avoiding chaos." Rules Committee Chairman Pete Sessions, R-Texas, said on Tuesday, defending the fines. In addition, Democrats are pointing to two new provisions added in the rules package that they say are designed to help the GOP effort to repeal Obamacare. One change would allow exceptions to the rule instituted by House Republicans in their recent budget plan that limits votes on any legislation that increases the federal deficit by $5 billion over a specific period. Republicans typically require any proposal that adds to the deficit has to be fully offset with cuts to other programs. "This rule is a set-up to overturn the Affordable Care Act," House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi maintained on Tuesday. Democrats also say that another change dealing with committee oversight could open up federal entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security to potential funding cuts. The new GOP rule directs certain committees to draft recommendations for shifting these programs from the mandatory side of the federal ledger to the discretionary side. While Democrats admit this is "inside baseball" they say that if it's implemented it could mean Congress would decide funding details for all of these programs as annual spending bills, potentially removing the automatic funding stream they now receive.

Huckabee was in Maale Adumim to lay the cornerstone for a new neighborhood in one of the largest Israeli settlements in the West Bank, just east of Jerusalem. The former Arkansas governor and strong supporter of Israel held a hat with the same catchphrase, and said he would bring one to Trump, whose campaign slogan "Make America Great Again" was the inspiration for the Maale Adumim banner. Huckabee told CNN that he rejected the use of the word "settlements." "I think Israel has title deed to Judea and Samaria," said Huckabee, using the Biblical terms for the West Bank. "There are certain words I refuse to use. There is no such thing as a West Bank. It's Judea and Samaria. There's no such thing as a settlement. They're communities, they're neighborhoods, they're cities. There's no such thing as an occupation." Settlements have surged back onto the international agenda following the recent United Nations Security Council resolution condemning Israeli settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem as having "no legal validity" and being "a flagrant violation under international law." Days later, Secretary of State John Kerry addressed settlements in a speech as an obstacle to peace between Israelis and Palestinians. Huckabee slammed Kerry's remarks, calling them "irrational" and "absolute bull butter." "It was insulting to me as an American, and I think certainly insulting to Israelis as well," he said. In the waning days of the Obama administration, the Kerry speech and the Security Council resolution have heightened interest in Trump's policies in the region. The President-elected has said he'd like to try making peace between Israelis and Palestinians, but he's also said he wants to move the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, moves Palestinian leaders have denounced as the death of a two-state solution. Though he does not serve as an adviser to Trump and is not part of his incoming administration, Huckabee, speaking as a private citizen, said he was optimistic about the relationship between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. "I think they're going to get along terrifically well. Because they're both plain-spoken people. They're both natural leaders. I think it's going to be a terrific relationship," said Huckabee, who added that he met with Netanyahu on his visit but declined to reveal what they discussed. Huckabee visited the settlements on the same day that Senate Republicans introduced a bill to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and move the embassy to Jerusalem. Called the "Jerusalem Embassy and Recognition Act," the bill requires the United States to act on a 1995 bill calling on the US to relocate the diplomatic mission. Since the bill's passage, every president -- both Republican and Democrat -- has waived the requirement of the move, citing national security considerations. The bill was introduced Tuesday by Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), Sen. Dean Heller (R-NV) and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX). "The only people who have ever had Yerushalayim as a capital have been the Jews," said Huckabee, using the Hebrew name of the city. "Nobody else has ever made this city a capital, ever. So it shouldn't even be controversial. Now it will be, but it shouldn't be." An evangelical Christian, Huckabee is a frequent visitor to the settlements. Last summer, he visited Shiloh, a settlement north of Jerusalem in the West Bank, that is the Biblical site where the Ark of the Covenant rested before it was carried into Jerusalem. Responding to Huckabee's visit to Maale Adumim on Tuesday, PLO Secretary General Saeb Erekat said, "The expansion of the illegal settlement of Maale Adumim threatens to forcibly transfer more Palestinians in (East Jerusalem) to make a way for more Israeli settlements and settlers in Occupied Palestine. "This is an attack against the international community's will to achieve a just, lasting, comprehensive peace and an incentive for extremists to perpetuate conflict and blood in our region," Erekat added.

The couple has secured a property in the tony Kalorama neighborhood, and Trump's team is confident that, at a minimum, his daughter and son-in-law can act as informal advisers once he's in the White House. That solution is unlikely to please ethics experts who have even taken to The New York Times opinion page to encourage Trump to ask Congress to amend the anti-nepotism statute in order to give limited family members formal roles. The transition team hasn't ruled out formal titles for Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump either. Discussions are still ongoing about whether it's possible to give the couple official titles in a way that would be appropriate and permissible under ethics and nepotism rules. Ivanka Trump has made clear that if she's advising her father in Washington, she will step back from her personal business. "As Ivanka has previously stated, she would separate herself from her businesses if asked to become an advisor to her father and the Trump administration," said a spokeswoman for the Ivanka Trump brand. It's not clear how Jared Kushner will navigate his own real estate business, though, and the Trump transition team declined to provide any details. Trump is expected to shed some light on the new management structure for his private business -- and the roles of his children -- at a news conference on January 11, Trump tweeted Tuesday. The President-elect has vowed via Twitter that his company won't execute any new deals while he's in office -- a step to guard against conflict of interest concerns. But sources said it's unlikely that Trump will go even further and fully divest from his company. One option that has been under consideration is bringing in an outside trustee to help guard against conflicts of interest, in addition to a leadership team that includes existing Trump organization executives and Trump's two sons. For Trump, the commitment to his enterprise goes beyond financial ties and includes a sentimental component as well. "President-elect Trump has always stated how much he loves what he does. Anyone who spends more than four decades building a 10 billion dollar empire would clearly be sentimental about relinquishing control," said Michael Cohen, an executive vice president for the Trump Organization. "However, President-elect Trump has also stated that there is nothing more important to him than fixing the mistakes made by the previous administration and Making America Great Again!" ©An NAACP sit-in to protest the nomination of US Sen. Jeff Sessions as US attorney general ended late Tuesday when six people were arrested at Sessions' Mobile, Alabama, office. The arrests of five men and one woman included NAACP President Cornell W. Brooks, said Malik Russell, director of communications for the civil rights group. They face charges of criminal trespass in the second-degree, according to Mobile police. The protesters arrived earlier Tuesday and said they would stay until Sessions is no longer the nominee or they were arrested. "We are asking the senator to withdraw his name for consideration as attorney general or for the President-elect, Donald Trump, to withdraw the nomination," Brooks said Tuesday afternoon from Sessions' office. "In the midst of rampant voter suppression, this nominee has failed to acknowledge the reality of voter suppression while pretending to believe in the myth of voter fraud." Earlier in the day, Alabama NAACP President Benard Simelton said he and 15-20 others were there "conducting business as usual" and would remain until "Sessions meets our demands or the arrest -- whichever he chooses." Sessions Brooks posted a photo on Twitter of himself, Simelton and two other activists in the office. Sessions, a former Alabama attorney general, has been a controversial figure in the past. His appointment to a federal district court in 1986 by then-President Ronald Reagan sank when Sessions spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores, in a statement to CNN, said the senator "has dedicated his career to upholding the rule of law, ensuring public safety and prosecuting government corruption." "Many African-American leaders who've known him for decades attest to this and have welcomed his nomination to be the next attorney general. These false portrayals of Sen.

When Congress returns to Washington on Tuesday, the Republican Party -- which controls the House and the Senate and will soon see GOP President-elect Donald Trump sworn into office -- will These first steps to unravel the Affordable Care Act have been years in the making, and will mark a symbolic victory for the conservative movement. Since Obama's 2008 election, no other single political and policy issue has been more effective in uniting the GOP in opposition and electrifying the party's base. The massive healthcare reform has fueled Republican rallying cries and partisan campaign messaging in every election since it became law in 2010. "People must remember that ObamaCare just doesn't work, and it is not affordable," Trump But repealing Obamacare won't be a clean political win for Republicans. In fact, dismantling the law will leave the GOP with a complicated political and policy conundrum: Even if Republican lawmakers delay the repeal from going effect for some years, as they are currently discussing, the initial vote will trigger a years-long, contentious fight over how to replace the law, and unleash widespread uncertainty for patients and the insurance market. In other words, Republicans could suddenly find themselves fielding the very kind of criticism and blame that they've been throwing at Democrats for years -- that of having created an untenable and unpopular healthcare system. And the question over how to fill the new gaps in healthcare coverage will expose ideological divisions among conservatives. "For Republicans, the challenge is following through on the promise not just to repeal the law -- because in some ways that's easy -- but to replace it," said Lanhee Chen, Mitt Romney's former chief policy adviser. Here's how we got to this moment, and why the stakes are enormous for Republicans: When Obama took office in January 2009, the country was spiraling into a deep recession and the new president's most urgent order of business was to stabilize the economy. But even amid the economic chaos, Obama moved full steam ahead with his top personal priority: reforming the country's healthcare system. His insistence on using his party's control at the time of both chambers of Congress to make sweeping healthcare reforms -- a goal that had eluded his Democratic predecessors -- would spark one of the most acrimonious political fights in Washington seen in modern history. Republicans warned that what Obama and his fellow Democrats were proposing would amount to a "government takeover" of the healthcare system. One of the most notorious and misleading phrases to emerge was "death panels" -- coined by former GOP vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin -- which stoked fears that the ACA would decide which Americans were worthy of receiving health coverage. After more than a year of bitter partisan debate, the House passed the bill in a 219-212 vote and sent it to Obama. All House Republicans voted in opposition. Then-GOP House Minority Leader John Boehner signaled his party's severe hostility towards the ACA when he lamented at the time: "Look at how this bill was written. Can you say it was done openly? With transparency and accountability? Without backroom deals that were struck behind closed doors? ... Hell no, you can't!" Democrats would quickly suffer the painful consequence of Obamacare at the ballot box. Seven months after Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law, the Democratic Party saw huge losses during the midterm elections. Running against the controversial reform, Republicans decisively took back control of the House and gained seats in the Senate. The election was an agonizing reality check for Democratic lawmakers -- particularly moderates and those in conservative areas -- who had expressed reservations about the controversial law. Former Democratic Rep. Bill Owens of New York, who was narrowly reelected in 2010, said Obamacare was one of the most contentious issues in all three of his congressional elections. "What the Republicans were able to do was gin up emotions about it," Owens told CNN. "And they did that very successfully, there's no doubt about it." Owens reflected that in retrospect, Democrats fundamentally mishandled the politics of the ACA. A major misstep, he said, was a failure to explain the realities of the new law to the American public as it struggled to understand how it would directly impact their coverage. "There was a failure to communicate the benefit that was being derived by large numbers of people," Obama said. "Democrats didn't do a good job of saying, 'We are getting people to a doctor.' And it was hard to explain that this was going to take some years before it starts to reduce the costs associated with healthcare. That's a very hard explanation." As Republicans continued to savage the law, the ACA suffered early setbacks. The law faced an onslaught of legal challenges, and in the summer of 2011, a federal appeals court ruled key provisions of Obamacare unconstitutional. In 2012, the Supreme Court Meanwhile, And in a major PR disaster, the Healthcare.gov website was hit with serious glitches in the fall of 2013, just as Republicans were paying a political price for shutting down the government over Obamacare. The portal crashed more than once, and along with many of the state exchanges, was largely unusable for weeks, leaving hundreds of thousands of people struggling to sign up for coverage. The fiasco only fueled GOP fury, and led to then-secretary of Health and Human Services, Kathleen Sebelius, to resign months later. Tevi Troy, the deputy secretary of Health and Human Services under President George W. Bush, said these mistakes helped ensure that Obamacare would remain a powerful weapon for Republicans. "They've run against it for so many cycles in large part because it's not popular and it's also not working the way it was touted to be working," Troy said. Repealing Obamacare comes with a whole lot of baggage. In fact, the GOP is about to be consumed by the hugely complex burden of replacing what they repeal. An estimated 20 million people obtained health coverage through the individual exchanges and Medicaid expansion, and Obamacare made major changes to the healthcare system, like preventing insurance companies from denying coverage to those with pre-existing conditions. "Democrats have not enjoyed owning what they've been calling a crap sandwich for the last six years. That's not a fun thing to own," Troy said. "They want to give that to Republicans as quickly as possible." As soon as Congress comes back to town on Tuesday, Republicans intend to act swiftly to begin the process of repealing the ACA through a fast-track budget reconciliation bill, but it could be days before the vote actually take place. But there's a catch: Republicans don't yet have a replacement plan. This is why GOP leaders are discussing a "replace and delay" option, which would keep the repeal from going into effect for a few years and buy time to figure out what's next. Already, the potential uncertainty is creating jitters among insurance companies, and experts warn that if insurers pull out of the marketplace, premiums could spike and millions are at risk of losing coverage. "They have shown nothing in their ranting and raving that shows any level of knowledge of where they would go or where they would take this," Pelosi told reporters Monday, describing the GOP strategy of "repeal and delay" as "an act of cowardice." Chen, the former Romney adviser, said it would be a "mistake" for the GOP to repeal Obamacare if there is no plan to replace it quickly. Republicans will have trouble getting help from Democrats on replacing major portion of the ACA -- a political reality that could also haunt the party in the next midterms. "Politically, I think Democrats are going to start to drag their heels on this," Chen said. "So (Republicans) have to be wary of the fact that Democrats see some political opportunity here, potentially." Obama is making a rare visit to Capitol Hill on Wednesday. His mission: The President is also expected to discuss the healthcare law in a "farewell" address in Chicago next week, aimed at touting his key accomplishments over the last eight years. The reality, of course, is that there's little that the President can do once he's out of office, and when it comes to Obamacare, Republicans have been emphatic about their intention to dismantle the law. To rally Republicans, Vice President-elect Mike Pence is also visiting the Hill Wednesday. How far Republicans can go in changing the fundamentals of the Affordable Care Act will determine Obamacare's place in the president's future legacy. GOP lawmakers have acknowledged concerns about messing with some of the law's most popular provisions, such as the pre-existing condition provision and the ability for parents to keep children on their plans until they are 26. "Ultimately, some form of Obamacare will be in existence 10 years from now," said Owens, the former Democratic congressman. "They will wind up making changes to it -- and they may even call it something else. But the depths of the law will probably stand for a very long time."

Rand Paul is warning fellow lawmakers of the possible dire consequences of killing Obamacare piecemeal. Paul, in an op-ed published Monday, called for the total The Kentucky senator argues that keeping popular provisions of President Barack Obama's signature health care law, while eliminating less popular, structural pieces, would "only accentuate the bankrupting of the insurance industry." He added: "If Congress fails to vote on a replacement at the same time as repeal, the repealers risk assuming the blame for the continued unraveling of Obamacare." The popular parts of the law -- such as one that allows individuals with pre-existing conditions to buy insurance after their diagnosis -- only work when the other parts like the individual mandate are maintained, Paul argued. "If you repeal this mandate, but leave in place dictates as to whom may purchase insurance, you create a business model doomed to fail," he wrote. Still, Paul avoided providing much in the way of specifics about a potential replacement system. Instead, he suggested that "perhaps we should try freedom," and sketched out four principles that should guide the formation of a potential replacement -- maintaining freedom of choice, offering health savings accounts, removing state-by-state barriers, and providing "the freedom for all individuals to join together in voluntary associations to gain the leverage of being part of a large insurance pool."

Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told reporters on Capitol Hill on Tuesday that he was working on the bill with a "broad group" of bipartisan senators. He said he hoped the bill would be released this week. "It will be a comprehensive bill that will provide congressional authorization for additional sanctions against Russia," Cardin said. The move comes as Russia has been a central focus in Washington. The White House and US intelligence community have said they are confident that Moscow sought to interfere in the US election through the hacking of Democratic political groups and sowing of distrust in the US government. In response to those actions and what the US government called inappropriate treatment of its diplomats overseas, the White House announced a fresh round of sanctions on Russia and expelled roughly three dozen diplomats last week. In addition, the intelligence community's classified comprehensive review of the hackings ordered by President Barack Obama is expected to be ready as early as this week, according to two US officials. Shortly after the completion of the review, President-elect Donald Trump is expected to be briefed specifically about the findings by intelligence community leaders, including Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and CIA Director John Brennan, according to one of the US officials. A declassified version of the report will be released publicly and will include newly declassified material that is expected to shed new light on why the administration believes Russia interfered in the election, according to US officials. Trump has repeatedly said he has doubts about the assertion, citing knowledge he has about the topic that he won't reveal. Throughout the 2016 campaign, he has spoken favorably about Russian President Vladimir Putin -- a position that has put him at odds with many members of his own party. Cardin said the sanctions legislation would focus in part on Russia's actions in Eastern Europe, including its annexation of the Crimean region of Ukraine, and also for its role in the Middle East, where it has been working to support the Assad regime in Syria. One of the most vocal critics of Putin in the GOP, Arizona Sen. John McCain, separately confirmed he was working with Cardin on the bill, but said the text was still in development. Asked if he was concerned about the proposal potentially being weakened, he said: "I've never been concerned about doing the right thing." He and fellow Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, had said they would be looking to implement sanctions against Putin and Russia as Congress returns to session. Cardin wasn't clear on whether the bill would force the President-elect's hand on sanctions or whether it would enshrine the sanctions that the White House announced last week, which Trump could otherwise roll back if he wanted to once in office. "It will complement and go beyond that," Cardin said of the White House actions. "It complements, but there's separation of powers." Cardin also didn't have details as to whether the bill would implement sanctions directly or create a vehicle for sanctions. In the meantime, Trump's nominee for secretary of state, Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson, was making the rounds on Capitol Hill, meeting with Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee opposite Cardin. Tillerson has faced hesitation from some GOP senators, including McCain, over his cozy relationship with Putin, which he has cultivated through his business interests in Russia. Corker told CNN he was hopeful that through his meetings, Tillerson could assuage wary Republicans. McCain and Cardin said they expected to sit down with Tillerson in the coming days.

Tom Cole of Oklahoma said Tuesday that President-elect Donald Trump deserves credit for persuading House Republicans to drop plans to eliminate an independent ethics office a day after voting to rein it in. On the first day of the new Congress, Trump tweeted, "With all that Congress has to work on, do they really have to make the weakening of the Independent Ethics Watchdog, as unfair as it ... may be, their number one act and priority. Focus on tax reform, healthcare and so many other things of far greater importance! #DTS." In an interview on CNN's "Erin Burnett OutFront," Cole, a deputy majority whip, said he agreed with Trump that other issues should have been tackled first and, "I think he deserves a lot of the credit." He added that it "probably wasn't the right time to do it" and that Trump "reinforced that today and had a big impact." But Cole said he supports reforms for the Office of Congressional Ethics, saying there have been bipartisan criticisms that numerous members of Congress have incorrectly been accused of wrongdoing only to later be exonerated. He predicted there will also be bipartisan support not to eliminate the office, but to reform it. He rejected criticism that the initial vote was done in secret, saying that many of the reforms came from a bipartisan commission from the previous Congress and that the reaction to the Monday vote was overblown. Cole also said Republicans including Sens. Lamar Alexander and Rand Paul make a fair point when they warn against repealing Obamacare without having a replacement plan in place. He said he believes the repeal of the health care law will come with a time delay and "it won't happen all in one fell swoop." "You won't repeal and replace on exactly the same day.

Attorneys for Trump and Zakarian appeared in DC Superior Court Tuesday afternoon for a status hearing to update the judge on where things stand in the lawsuit. The attorney for Trump explained that the parties have continued to engaged in settlement discussions, but currently are at an impasse and ready to set a trial date. The judge asked whether the parties would benefit from a new mediator in the case, but the attorneys declined. The judge set a pretrial conference date for May 17. Trump is expected to sit for a seven-hour deposition in a related case with chef Jose Andres before he takes office, as soon as this week. Trump requested that the deposition take place in New York. Should the Zakarian trial proceed, it will create a legal spectacle for the new President. Zakarian and Andres pulled out of agreements to open restaurants in Trump's Washington hotel following Trump's 2015 reference to some Mexican immigrants as "rapists." Trump sued the chefs separately for breach of contract, seeking more than $10 million in damages apiece, and they countersued. Attorneys in the Zakarian case previewed in court Tuesday that much of the expert testimony in the case will address Trump's claims of future lost profits from the restaurant deal, as well as what he did to mitigate the loss. ©WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has repeated his claim that the Russian government was not the source of hacked Democratic campaign emails his organization released before the US presidential election. The Obama administration, citing US intelligence sources, has accused Russia of orchestrating the hacking of emails from the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta in an attempt to influence the election's outcome. The administration says it is " In an interview that aired Tuesday on Fox News' "Hannity," Assange was asked if WikiLeaks' source of the hacked material was "Russia or anyone associated with Russia." "Our source is not a state party. So the answer -- for our interactions -- is no," Assange told anchor Sean Hannity from his quarters at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he has lived under diplomatic protection since 2012. Pressed on the source of the emails leaked by WikiLeaks in the weeks and months leading up to the November election, Assange repeated, "Our source is not the Russian government. It is not state parties." He was not asked directly if he believed Russia orchestrated the hacking. Reacting to the Hannity interview, 2008 US vice presidential candidate and one-time Fox News contributor Sarah Palin, once a vociferous opponent of WikiLeaks, posted an apology to Assange on Facebook. "This important information (the emails) that finally opened people's eyes to democrat candidates and operatives would not have been exposed were it not for Julian Assange," she wrote. "I apologize for condemning Assange when he published my infamous (and proven noncontroversial, relatively boring) emails years ago. "Julian, I apologize." Trump weighed in on Twitter on Wednesday morning, saying "Julian Assange said 'a 14 year old could have hacked Podesta -- why was DNC so careless? Also said Russians did not give him the info!" As with Palin's about-face, the President-elect's citation of the WikiLeaks founder represents a markedly different attitude toward the whistleblowing organization. CNN's KFile Speaking on camera to preview Kilmeade's radio show, Trump said: "I think it's disgraceful, I think there should be like death penalty or something," during the quick exchange. Assange also denied talking to Russian President Vladimir Putin, his surrogates or anyone associated with the Trump campaign. He suggested that President Barack Obama was "acting like a lawyer" with the hacking allegations. "If you look at most of his statements, he doesn't say ... WikiLeaks obtained its information from Russia, worked with Russia." He said the content of the emails that WikiLeaks published was germane to the US election and the concerns of the electorate, and dominated much of the election cycle in the weeks leading up to November 8. "Was (the leaked information) influential? Did it have a lot of influence? Statistically, yes. It was the No. 1 topic on Facebook throughout October. The No. 1 (political) topic on Twitter, also, throughout October. "Did it change the outcome? Who knows. It's absolutely impossible to tell." Assange also told Hannity he would have "absolutely" released information about Trump and his campaign if he had received it. He added that the White House's "dramatic response," directly accusing Russia of orchestrating the hacks, is an attempt to "delegitimize" Trump's presidency, something he believes the defeated party will continue to do.

The announcement comes weeks after several longtime campaign staffers began to gripe publicly that White House roles were taking too long to take shape and that Republican National Committee staffers had an edge in earning White House jobs. "These individuals will be key leaders in helping to implement the President-elect's agenda and bring real change to Washington," White House chief of staff Reince Priebus said in a statement, calling the staffers "instrumental" in helping Trump.

Trump will also retain his campaign body man John McEntee as personal aide to the President. Many other longtime campaign staffers have not yet officially snagged White House jobs, but the campaign called the announcement a "first wave" of staff announcements.

It wasn't a 2008 style kickoff in Springfield, Illinois, or 2016 style start on Roosevelt Island, New York, or even a grand entrance on a descending escalator in a Manhattan tower. In 2017, the campaign starting gun went off in dueling rallies inside the US Capitol, during an extraordinary morning of drama and theater emblematic of the coming Trump era. The Vice President-elect arriving in one corner of the Capitol, and almost simultaneously, split screen, the outgoing president arriving in another. This year's campaign is of course not about electing a president or member of Congress or any politician, it is about deciding the future of America's health care system -- something that affects all Americans, whether they voted or not. Just like in 2009, when Obamacare was before Congress and Democrats spread out across America to try to sell the law to their constituents, they'll hold events back home starting this weekend to try to fight Republican plans to dismantle it. House Democratic Caucus Chairman Joe Crowley, D-New York, is leading the charge in the House, encouraging members to hold events in their districts this Saturday, January 7, in order to highlight what Democrats warn are the risks of repealing the Affordable Care Act. Next, Democrats are branding January 15 a "National Day of Action" among Democratic senators, House members and grass-roots organizations. In his closed door pep rally with congressional Democrats, President Barack Obama even encouraged his party to use tea party tactics to galvanize Americans to urge Republicans not to dismantle the health care plan -- which happens to be the cornerstone of his legacy. But the analogy is hardly perfect. Anyone who remembers the raucous town halls of 2009 knows it was the Democrats trying to sell Obamacare who got shouted down by constituents who didn't like the law, and were encouraged by conservative media and the brewing tea party movement. Still, there could be a silver lining here for Democrats. Post-2016, their base is wounded, disoriented and scared. It's similar to the way the Republican base looked and felt back in 2009 after Obama won and the Democrats took a supermajority in the Senate. The GOP was in the wilderness, and the fight against Obamacare became a motivator for Republicans to find their way back. If done right, and if successful, this new campaign to save Obamacare could rejuvenate despondent Democrats. As for Republicans, they realize their campaign is fraught with peril. Just look at the President-elect's own tweets. He woke the morning of this 2017 campaign start and took to Twitter to warn his own Republican brethren to "be careful" not to go too far in their zest for repeal. Vice President-elect Mike Pence expounded on that after meeting with House Republicans. "It will be important that we be careful as we do that. that we do that in a way that doesn't work a hardship on American families. who have gained insurance, through this program -- doesn't work hardship on our economy," said Pence. But he also lifted the veil on Republican concerns that their push to repeal Obamacare may get drowned out by Democrats stories of real people who have benefited from the program, and warnings about loss in insurance coverage and rattled markets a repeal may bring. That's what Pence meant when he admonished GOP members: "Remind American people of what they already know about Obamacare that the promises that were made were all broken, and I expect you'll see an effort in the days ahead to talk about the facts around Obamacare." When then-White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel argued forcefully to use the Democrats huge 2009 majorities to pass health care reform, he did so by predicting that once Americans have a benefit, they won't want to lose it. It is going to be a long 2017 as we watch and learn whether he was right.

Trump has earned a reputation for making unpredictable statements on Twitter that often depart from long-standing US policies and he's made several controversial comments about China. "The obsession with 'Twitter diplomacy' is undesirable," said the bylined commentary, which only appeared on the agency's Chinese website. Xinhua is the biggest and most influential of China's state-run media. "It is a commonly accepted that diplomacy is not a child's game -- and even less is it business dealing. As former United States Secretary of State [Madeleine] Albright said, Twitter should not be a tool for foreign policy," the commentary, which was published this week, said. Albright served under former President Bill Clinton and was a vocal supporter of Trump's democratic rival Hillary Clinton. In a Tweet late Monday, Trump suggested that China wasn't doing enough He's also used Twitter to accuse China of keeping its currency artificially low, of military posturing in the South China Sea and to announce that he'd spoken China's official reaction to Trump has been relatively muted. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs went as far saying it was However, The Global Times, a provocative but state-sanctioned tabloid, has gone further, calling Trump "ignorant as a child in foreign policy" and "pandering to irresponsible attitudes."

The political message behind the bill: It's not true that Republicans don't have a plan to replace the Affordable Care Act. Members of the House Republican Study Committee, led by its chairman, Reps. Mark Walker, and Phil Roe, were emphatic in a news conference that the increasingly heated accusation from Democrats -- that Republicans have failed to craft a plan to replace what they repeal from Obamacare -- was simply not true. "I heard again on the House floor when I was down there... just a few minutes ago, how Republicans have no ideas. That's absolutely false," Roe said. "We have a plan." Walker added: "We've got to get out there, we've got to get runners on base." "Our job is not to delay any longer," he said. "Our job is to come out of the gate with a particular piece of legislation that garnered more votes than any other legislation in both the 113th and 114th Congress." The legislation has been previously introduced by Roe, a physician from Tennessee, but has not received the endorsement of GOP leadership. While it is unlikely to become the main vehicle in the House to repeal Obamacare, it could attract support from a swath of House Republicans. The bill includes several ideas that Republican lawmakers have advocated for years, such as tax credits to help offset the cost of health coverage and allowing Americans to purchase insurance across state lines. The legislation also includes provisions to reform medical liability laws. To pay for the plan, the conservatives proposed an across-the-board cut in non-defense domestic programs over the next several years. The RSC's proposal is likely to be one of multiple GOP proposals that emerge from the House and the Senate in the coming months as the Obamacare repeal and replace debate heats up. Earlier in the day, Walker acknowledged to CNN that the process would be complex and drawn out. "I would call this a Round One of a 15-round heavyweight fight," Walker said. The unveiling of the Republican Study Committee's Obamacare bill comes on the second day of the new Congress, as Republicans and Democrats are quickly drawing their battle lines on the ACA. Touting the slogan "Make America Sick Again" in a play off of President-elect Donald Trump's campaign slogan, Democrats are warning that Republicans are about disrupt millions of people's health coverage -- without offering an alternative solution. And Republicans -- as quick as they have been to get the process of repeal started -- have acknowledged that they do not yet have a concrete plan to replace what they roll back. GOP leaders are currently considering passing a repeal bill but holding off on the repeal from going into effect for a few years. But even this strategy, healthcare experts say, wouldn't prevent insurance companies from fleeing the individual marketplace or spiking premiums -- a reality that has some Republicans on edge about moving too quickly on repeal. Vice President-elect Mike Pence visited with GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill earlier in the day to chart a path forward on rolling back Obamacare. In a press conference after the meeting, Pence told reporters that the party intends to draw from a "broad range" of ideas as it starts crafting a replacement plan. "Republicans have been offering those ideas again and again literally every year since Obamacare was first signed into law," Pence said. House Speaker Paul Ryan once again emphasized that a "transition" period will be necessary. "We want to make sure that as we give relief to people to Obamacare, we do it in a transition that doesn't pull the rug out from anybody during that transition period," Ryan said. "We want to make sure that as we give relief to people to Obamacare, we do it in a transition that doesn't pull the rug out from anybody during that transition period," Ryan said. ©Sen. Debbie Stabenow said Wednesday Republicans should be worried about the effects repealing the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, will have on Americans who rely on it. "If they want to, they can rip apart the entire health care system. They have the votes in the House, they have the votes in the Senate, they have the new President coming in," the Michigan Democrat told CNN's Erin Burnett on "Erin Burnett OutFront." "But know that they really will pull the thread that will unravel the entire system." She added: "We're going to be telling the story and fighting for people ... this is craziness, Erin, that's going on right now, here, with the idea of repealing and unraveling the whole health care system, creating instability in one-sixth of the entire economy with no plan to replace it." Stabenow, who serves in the Senate Democratic leadership team, said she has some ideas on how to tackle problems with Obamacare, including the rising costs of insurance. "What we need to do is fix that by adding more competition," she said. "This is a private marketplace competition way of providing health insurance, and one of the ways we can fix that ... is by adding a public option like many of us wanted to do at the beginning so there is a true competition of marketplace." "I'd be willing to walk from this interview and sit down immediately with Republican colleagues, we've been trying to for six years, and say, 'Let's improve on this system,'" Stabenow said. "But you don't do that by burning down a house when you say you want to renovate it. You don't start by burning it down. And that's exactly what you're doing." President Barack Obama visited Capitol Hill Wednesday, urging Democrats to not "rescue" Republicans by helping them pass replacement measures in a closed-door meeting. In response to Obama's message, Stabenow said she is willing to work with the GOP to help. "What I'm saying tonight is instead of repealing and creating chaos in the marketplace, if folks want to sit down and work on improvements, I'm all in," she said.

Unless he changes course, Trump will take office having invested more credibility in the views of Russian President Vladimir Putin and WikiLeaks fugitive Julian Assange than in leading US intelligence agencies. His dismissal of assessments by US analysts that Russia meddled in November's election has already soured his ties with America's leading espionage agencies. But his move Wednesday to invoke Assange, who has spilled some of the nation's most closely held secrets, to raise questions about Russia's influence in American politics could poison his relations with rank-and-file intelligence operatives along with some leading Republicans on Capitol Hill. Trump defended himself Thursday, tweeting: "The dishonest media likes saying that I am in Agreement with Julian Assange - wrong. I simply state what he states, it is for the people....to make up their own minds as to the truth. The media lies to make it look like I am against "Intelligence" when in fact I am a big fan! But the clash is ultimately a battle of wits between Trump, who never likes to admit he is wrong, and intelligence agencies that insist they have the evidence to back up their conclusions about the Kremlin's alleged election operation. The confrontation, and the political divisions it has opened, will be center stage on Thursday when "This is a power struggle like we have never seen before between an incoming president and the intelligence community," Rod Beckstrom, former head of the National Cybersecurity Center, told CNN's Brooke Baldwin Wednesday on "Newsroom." "In this case, Trump is making very clear from day one, 'I am the leader here, sit down and listen to me.' He's putting the (intelligence community) in an extremely difficult position." Trump's decision to cite Assange was extraordinary. While he is viewed in some quarters of the world as a heroic whistleblower, Assange is wanted in Washington over the publication of hundreds of thousands of documents related to the Iraq War and classified embassy cables. Some US officials believe his disclosures endangered US troops serving the field. He has holed up in the Ecuadorian embassy in London since 2012 and returned to prominence Tuesday evening when an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity -- one of Trump's biggest media backers -- aired. Assange's entire philosophy is to undermine US and allied governments. That's what makes it so stunning that an incoming American president would go out of his way to cite him as a credible source. Trump could hardly have cited a more radioactive figure had he been intending to insult US intelligence and State Department personnel who were left to deal with the fallout of one of the biggest leaks of classified intelligence ever. "It's a sad day when politicians place more stock in Vladimir Putin and Julian Assange than in the Americans who risk their lives daily to provide objective non-partisan intelligence analysis," one US intelligence official told CNN. Those views are shared by many Republicans. "In Julian Assange's world, we're the bad guys," South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham told CNN Wednesday. "Not the Iranians, not the Russians, not the North Koreans." He added: "You've got to remember who this guy is." Trump's series of tweets on WikiLeaks were not his only new swipe at US spy chiefs. On Tuesday, he complained that a scheduled briefing he had requested on the alleged Russian hacking had been delayed until Friday. "Perhaps more time needed to build a case. Very strange!" Trump tweeted. Intelligence agency chiefs said the meeting with CIA Director John Brennan and James Clapper, the director of National Intelligence, was never due to take place before Friday. The feud is already raising questions about how far the disconnect between the next president and the intelligence community -- which is at the fulcrum of everything the US government does in the world -- could harm US security. "Let's stare this reality square in the face: PEOTUS is pro-Putin and believes Julian Assange over the @CIA. On Jan. 20 we will be less safe," said George Little, a former CIA spokesman, on Twitter. Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Trump's statements were alarming. "That he would now cite people like Assange who have demonstrated universal hostility to the United States and its interests takes him into new and even more treacherous territory," he said in a statement. "With every conspiracy theory-laden tweet and erratic off-the-cuff comment, the President-elect does damage to our national security, while raising new concerns about his capacity to grow into the job." Former House Intelligence Committee chairman Mike Rogers, a Republican who is now a CNN analyst, said Trump needed to undergo a "maturation process." "He is going to need the CIA and the CIA is going to need him," he told CNN's Jim Scuitto on "The Lead." Aides on Capitol Hill say GOP lawmakers are privately expressing disbelief and incredulity at Trump's continued insistence on believing Russia over the US intelligence community. Everything they have seen points to Russian responsibility for election-related activity, the aides say, and add that Republicans hope Trump comes around. One theory that might explain his behavior is his extreme sensitivity to any suggestion that his November election triumph was not legitimate. He appears to view debate about Russia's role through that prism, and his aides have repeatedly tried to spin such talk as a Democratic plot to undermine him. Some intelligence community officials believe that Trump's hostility might be based on a misunderstanding. "The intelligence community is not saying that Vladimir Putin won the election for Trump," one official told CNN on Wednesday. "We're saying they did a series of things to sow doubt and some people think they wanted Trump to win, but no one has ever said they got into the mechanics of the ballot boxes." If it lingers, the bad feeling between the President-elect and the spies he will soon command could also have a corrosive impact on the analysts and agents who do America's most secret work. There will be fears for morale, especially among those who serve in covert missions in hostile foreign theaters with only a promise of a star on the CIA's Memorial Wall if they are killed. CNN Intelligence Analyst Phil Mudd, who worked in counter-intelligence for the CIA, warned that Trump risked badly damaging his credibility. "Who enters a management relationship dissing the entire workforce before they even meet not only the workforce but talk to the leadership of the workforce?" Mudd asked. ©President-elect Donald Trump is looking at possible ways to limit the power of the director of National Intelligence, according to sources close to the transition. The thinking within the Trump transition team is that the DNI often gets in the way of the 16 intelligence agencies it represents, which includes the CIA, the sources told CNN. Trump has been a harsh critic of US intelligence agencies. He has been skeptical of the US intelligence community saying Russia was behind the hacking meant to influence the outcome of the 2016 election. The possible move was first reported by Trump is also considering expanding the CIA's human spying capabilities but wants an assessment once new intelligence leadership is in place, according to sources close to the transition. There has been building criticism among conservatives that the CIA under President Barack Obama has been too reliant on electronic spying and the NSA's signals intelligence. Trump's incoming press secretary called reports that Trump would restructure US intelligence agencies "100% false" on Thursday. "All transition activities are for information gathering purposes and all discussions are tentative," Sean Spicer told reporters on a press call. "The President-elect's top priority will be to ensure the safety of the American people and the security of the nation and he is committed to finding the best and most effective way to do it. But I want to reiterate, there is no truth to this idea of restructuring the intelligence community infrastructure, it is 100% false." Trump seemingly taunted the US intelligence agencies who are supposed to brief him on alleged Russian hacking via Twitter on Tuesday. He suggested that intelligence officials postponed an "'intelligence' briefing on so-called 'Russian hacking'" that they were set to deliver to him this week because they might need more time "to build a case." He called the alleged delay "very strange." US intelligence officials disputed Trump's tweet, saying the meeting was not set to take place until later in the week. Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, warned curbing the DNI's power will "diminish its effectiveness and reverse many of the important gains we had made since 9/11." "It is appropriately staffed and resourced," he said in a statement Wednesday night. "Moreover, to propose changing the CIA's operational structure because of loose allegations of politicization -- claims based on nothing more than the agency's willingness to contradict the President-elect's preferred version of events -- would be a mistake of the highest order." One source said that Retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn -- Trump's pick for national security adviser -- has pushed the idea of reigning in the DNI. Flynn was pushed out as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014, which falls under the DNI's leadership. Flynn clashed with other intelligence officials, including his bosses Mike Vickers, the Pentagon's undersecretary for intelligence, and DNI James Clapper. The office of the Director of National Intelligence was created in 2004 to help coordinate intelligence between the different agencies, as a response to the Sept 11 terrorist attacks. The DNI rolled out a reorganization in 2015 that focused on giving more focus to field offices and Intel gathering, grouping analysis and gathering in field hubs for instance. ©President-elect Donald Trump will face several significant hurdles if he attempts to quickly make good on a campaign promise to deport millions of undocumented immigrants from the United States, according to multiple immigration experts and law enforcement officials interviewed by CNN. The likely obstacles to any mass deportation effort include required congressional approval for increased spending, vows of resistance by leaders in several major cities that are home to large numbers of potential deportees and long waits for removal proceedings in US immigration court. "He's hamstrung," said Muzaffar Chishti of the Migration Policy Institute, a non-partisan Washington-based think tank. "He did not understand that we don't have a monarchy. We did not elect King Trump." As Trump's inauguration approaches, there has been widespread handwringing among undocumented immigrants and their advocates as they wait to see how US immigration policy may change under a Trump administration. But there is mounting evidence that whatever actions he takes will not match the harsh rhetoric of the campaign trail. He's already waffled on his promise to build a wall, saying that existing fencing may suffice in some sections of the border. His controversial pledge of a temporary ban on all Muslims entering the US seems all but forgotten. That leaves the deportation pledge. "Mr. Trump will not be able or willing to engage in the kind of mass deportations that he promised in his campaign," said Stephen Legomsky, a professor emeritus at Washington University School of Law in St. Louis. "Simply finding large numbers of undocumented immigrants with criminal records is much more difficult than it sounds," said Legomsky, who served as former chief counsel to US Citizenship and Immigration Services from 2011 to 2013 and as a senior counselor to Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson in 2015. Legomsky, who has since left government, said any such effort would be "incredibly laborious" and cost prohibitive. Early in the presidential campaign, Trump said all 11 million illegal immigrants in the US should be deported. He seemed to soften his stance after the election, telling CBS' "60 Minutes" that he would prioritize going after undocumented immigrants who had committed crimes beyond being in the country illegally. The irony of that approach, experts say, is that it would be much easier for Trump to locate and begin deportation proceedings of non-criminals such as those granted temporary amnesty under President Barack Obama's Deferred Action For Childhood Arrivals Program. The program, known as DACA, granted some 840,000 childhood-arrivals to the US temporary protection from deportation and issued them work permits. It was created by executive memorandum in 2012 and could be immediately rescinded by the Trump administration, stripping DACA participants of their protection against deportation. Going after undocumented immigrants with criminal records could prove more difficult and would likely require congressional approval to pay for more Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to round up potential deportees who do not want to be found. Key to that effort would be the cooperation of local law enforcement who run county jails and have the ability to alert ICE agents to the presence of undocumented immigrants with criminal records in their custody. Such inmates can be placed on an ICE "detainer" indicating that they are to be handed over to immigration officials when they finish their sentences. This could provide a steady flow of potential deportees without having to conduct costly and time-consuming searches. But many big cities with large undocumented immigrant populations have said they would refuse to cooperate with such deportations under most circumstances. Some cities, including Los Angeles and Chicago, have set up legal defense funds for undocumented immigrants facing deportation. Trump has threatened to withhold federal funding from cities that don't cooperate with US immigration efforts -- an approach that could cripple local schools, police departments and airports, among others. But Chishti predicted any such effort would face an immediate legal challenge. He said there were several Supreme Court cases that stood for the proposition that the federal government can't indiscriminately "hold a gun to the states' head." A threat to withhold funds, he said, "must be in relation to the dispute at hand." Even if officials were able to initiate a surge in deportation cases, such an effort would likely stall in immigration court where there is currently a backlog of more than a half million cases and a wait time of nearly two years. Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center For Immigration Studies, a non-partisan think tank in Washington, said Trump's campaign pledges to deport millions amounted to an "Archie Bunker moment" that should not have been taken seriously. "He's not going to be snapping his fingers and deporting millions of people over night," said Krikorain, whose group's motto is "Low-Immigration, pro-immigrant." "That's not realistic," Krikorian said. "No one thinks that's going to happen." But Krikorian said "it's very plausible" that Trump could ramp up deportations by 25% or more in 2017 and return to levels seen under Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, which he said reached about 400,000 a year when Bush left office. That, he said, could be done without significant budgetary increases and despite resistance from sanctuary cities. "I think the other side is making it seem more complicated than it needs to be," he said. Stephen Yale-Loehr, who teaches immigration law at Cornell Law School, agreed that Trump would be able to have meaningful impact during the first year of his presidency, but not to the extent suggested during the campaign. "On the campaign trail things are not nuanced. They're black and white," Yale-Loehr said. "It takes a while to turn the battleship of bureaucracy around." "On the campaign trail things are not nuanced. They're black and white," Yale-Loehr said. "It takes a while to turn the battleship of bureaucracy around." ©A senior adviser to President-elect Donald Trump said Wednesday that he doesn't think anyone should be listening to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Former CIA director James Woolsey, a top adviser to Trump on national security issues, weighed in on Trump using remarks from Assange to continue to raise questions about the intelligence community's findings that Russian hackers interfered in the 2016 election. "I don't think there's any point in listening to Julian Assange," Woolsey said on "CNN Tonight." "He's quite a ne'er-do-well." Asked as a former CIA director if he would have listened to Assange or his intelligence officials, Woolsey said he doesn't think he would have to only listen to CIA analysts. "I would listen to someone who I think is making a cogent point and doing it with good evidence," Woolsey said. "I don't start from the proposition of I'll listen to X because I like or don't like him." When asked by Don Lemon about US intelligence officials telling CNN they are concerned with Trump's public attacks, Woolsey defended Trump's tough talk, citing politics as an element with in the intelligence community. "They're going to have to get used to working for a new boss," Woolsey said. "He's the one who won the election. And the intelligence community was frankly, I think ready, willing and able to support Hillary, but they were really stunned and not quite ready to try to figure out how to deal with the winner." "They're going to have to get used to working for a new boss," Woolsey said. "He's the one who won the election. And the intelligence community was frankly, I think ready, willing and able to support Hillary, but they were really stunned and not quite ready to try to figure out how to deal with the winner." ©President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday used comments from WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange to continue raising questions about the allegation that Russian hackers attempted to influence American politics -- a charge the US intelligence community and the Obama administration has defended with increasing vigor. Trump tweeted Wednesday morning, hours after the broadcast of an interview Assange gave Fox News' Sean Hannity, to blame Democrats for not having tighter cybersecurity. "Somebody hacked the DNC but why did they not have 'hacking defense' like the RNC has and why have they not responded to the terrible things they did and said (like giving the questions to the debate to H). A total double standard! Media, as usual, gave them a pass." Trump's comments again put him at odds with Republican leaders on the Hill -- including Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan -- who have shown support for the Intelligence Community's uniform assessment that Russia hacked American political targets with the intent of disrupting US elections. The Vice President-elect said Wednesday at a press conference that Trump has a "healthy American skepticism" about the conclusions made by the intelligence community. "I think that the President-elect has expressed his very sincere and healthy American skepticism about intelligence conclusions," said Mike Pence, who said he's received regular intelligence briefings. When asked about Assange on Hugh Hewitt's radio show Wednesday morning, Ryan responded, "I have really nothing (to say) other than the guy is a sycophant for Russia. He leaks. He steals data and compromises national security." Sen. Lindsey Graham said Wednesday that Americans -- including the President-elect -- should stay away from giving Assange much credibility considering his views of the United States. "I don't believe any American should give a whole lot of credibility to what Mr. Assange says," the South Carolina Republican said on CNN's "At this Hour." "In Julian Assange's world, we're the bad guys -- not the Iranians, not the Russians, not the North Koreans. You gotta remember who this guy is." US intelligence agencies are a far more reliable source on foreign involvement in an American election than Assange, Graham said. "Mr. Assange is a fugitive from the law, hiding in an embassy, who has a history of undermining American interest. I hope no American will be duped by him," he said. "I hope the President-elect will get his information and trust the American patriots who work in the Intelligence Community who swear oaths of allegiance to the Constitution and not some guy hiding from the law who has a record of undercutting and undermining American democracy." The DNC responded to Trump's message Wednesday, saying the President-elect is " is putting his own insecurities ahead of national security because he is sensitive about how he won." "It's nothing short of terrifying that Trump has chosen to take the word of an enemy of our country over the word of 17 United States intelligence agencies including the CIA, the FBI, and the NSA," Adrienne Watson, DNC national press secretary, said in a statement. "Trump is jeopardizing America's future with his fear of offending Vladimir Putin." In the Fox News interview, Assange denied that Russia was the source of leaked Democratic emails that roiled the 2016 election to the detriment of Trump's rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton. Instead, Assange said the documents -- which were stolen from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta's email -- were easily obtained through a "phishing" solicitation, whereby Podesta mistakenly gave up his password. "We published several emails which show Podesta responding to a phishing email," Assange said Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin -- an early Trump supporter -- responded to Assange's interview with an apology and a reversal. Palin lavished praise on Assange in a Facebook post after watching Assange on Fox. She wrote that Podesta's emails contained "important information that finally opened people's eyes to democrat candidates and operatives" and which "would not have been exposed were it not for Julian Assange." "I apologize for condemning Assange when he published my infamous (and proven noncontroversial, relatively boring) emails years ago," Palin had previously been a strident critic of Assange and WikiLeaks: The site had published some of Palin's personal emails in 2008, which were hacked while she was a candidate for vice president, and Palin accused Assange of endangering US military personnel by publishing a raft of State Department cables containing highly sensitive information.

He has showered praise on Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling him "very smart!," and dismissed charges that Moscow tried to hack the election process -- even as he's bashed China for currency manipulation, skewing trade and failing to rein in North Korea. It's unusual enough for a president-elect to try to sway foreign policy before he's in office, let alone in 140-character bursts. While Trump aides have said some of his statements shouldn't be taken "literally," the tweets offer insight to his foreign policy views and raise a question: When both China and Russia are challenging US power globally, why does he favor Moscow and not Beijing? Trump's positions on Russia and China mark a sharp turn from current policies -- and that might to the point. Trump and much of the Republican establishment have made clear they aim to dismantle parts of President Barack Obama's legacy. Trump is also looking to use international relations in pursuit of economic ends, even as some observers worry his approach is based on misperceptions of economic forces. Some analysts point to the possibility that Trump is taking a deeply strategic approach; others say he simply fails to understand the crucial importance of long-standing US alliances. At the least, it is an approach that contrasts with Obama, who has tried to find areas of common interest with China to bridge serious divides. At the same time, he has endeavored, with little success, to isolate Russia for a series of international violations. "It's a sign of confusion if you're making trouble with the Chinese at the same time as you're making trouble with US allies in Asia, and it's a sign of confusion if you're trying to make up with Russia at the same that you're not tending to American alliances in Europe," said Steven Sestanovich, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. Trump "acts like a guy who thinks he can make everybody mad at the same time and not pay a price for it," Sestanovich said. Russia has conducted a stealth invasion of Ukraine, annexed Crimea -- the first attempt to alter European borders by force since World War II -- and is believed to have supplied the missile that brought down Malaysian Airlines flight MH17, shot down over Ukraine in 2014. Moscow has supported Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in his country's civil war, including in the bombing of civilians in Aleppo, in direct opposition to the US. The Russian military has buzzed US aircraft and ships. And the US intelligence community found with "high confidence" that Russia was behind hacking during the presidential election campaign meant to sow doubts about American democracy. And yet Trump speaks warmly of Putin and his desire for better cooperation with Russia, publicly dismissing the hacking allegations and accusing the intelligence community of acting politically. That stand has damaged morale within the intelligence community and puzzled observers who wonder whether it's a strategic decision or a function of Trump's admiration for authoritarian figures, possible business deals with Russian oligarchs, or as-yet-undiscovered links or financial debts. Russian officials have said they were in contact with the Trump campaign throughout the election. Matt Rojansky, head of the Kennan Institute at the Wilson Center, said one reason could be Trump's belief that the US should do more work with Russia to defeat terrorism and his view of that challenge as a "civilizational battle between radical Islam and, broadly speaking, the forces of Western civilization." Trump and his aides, particularly his future national security adviser, retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, are much more comfortable including Russia under the "Western civilization" umbrella than prominent Republicans such as Arizona Sen. John McCain and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, Rojansky said. That will cause friction, possibly sooner rather than later. McCain will hold hearings Thursday to examine Russia's role in the election hacking. The Arizona senator and Graham have announced that they will also lead new sanctions against Russia. McCain already is working on legislation with the leading Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin. If Trump's stance on Russia might fray some of his alliances in Congress, he's already put European allies on edge with his warmth toward Putin and questions about the worth of NATO. He's also unnerved Asian allies by questioning the cost of helping Japan and South Korea defend themselves. "I can see why it's a temptation for a big shot like Trump to think that smaller powers don't matter and you just solve your problems with the other big guys," said Sestanovich, who is also a professor at Columbia University. "That's just a mistake. The other guys are going to eat your lunch if you have let American alliance ties wither. I think that's what he doesn't get." He said that, "The biggest lever we have with the Chinese is our network of alliances, similarly with the Russians." Some analysts have suggested Trump is practicing a sophisticated version of the "triangular diplomacy" former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and President Richard Nixon used to play the Soviet Union and China off against each other in the 1970s. But the two nations are no longer bitter enemies and instead have a well-defined, if mutually wary, relationship. "There's no way by improving relations with Russia you get a significant bang for your buck with the Chinese," Sestanovich said. China, like Russia, has targeted the US with cyberattacks. Beijing has pushed US companies in China to give up proprietary technology, it has contested US claims to freedom of navigation through Asian waters, its military has buzzed US naval vessels and Air Force jets, and it recently stole a US underwater drone. If Trump seems to look the other way on Russian transgressions, China gets no free pass. The President-elect, who manufactures parts of his clothing line in China, often charges that Beijing steals American jobs with unfair trade practices. "China has been taking out massive amounts of money & wealth from the U.S. in totally one-sided trade, but won't help with North Korea. Nice!" he tweeted Monday. Soon after winning the presidency, he antagonized Beijing by holding a phone conversation with Taiwan's leader. Trump has long made China a bogeyman, accusing it in a 2012 tweet of having "created" the concept of global warming in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive. He has particularly fixated on China's economic practices, blasting it on trade and currency throughout the presidential race and blaming it for the loss of American jobs. Trade and job losses were central rallying cries of his campaign. Richard Bush, director of the Center for East Asia Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution, said Trump's criticisms reflect a lack of understanding about international economics. "The jobs China is accused of stealing, many were lost a long time ago to Korea or Japan and moved from there to China," he said. "A lot of that job loss occurred because of technology change," he said. And despite Trump's promises to bring jobs back to the US, Bush said, "Nobody in the US would do them at the wages companies would want to charge. Those jobs are never going to be gotten back." Bush also pointed out that there are limits to how much any US president can change relations with China. "Will the American business community sit idly by and watch Trump undertake a trade war with China? They have a lot at stake in this," he said. In the meantime, Trump's stream of anti-Chinese Tweets poses risks, he said. While Trump might be trying to create bargaining positions or exert pressure, his tweets might be misunderstood, Bush said, creating the chance that "China would regard a potential challenge as more dangerous than it actually might be."

On January 20, Eidinger, alongside other marijuana legalization advocates, are going to hand out up to two ounces of marijuana in the form of 4,200 joints to people in Washington's Dupont Circle. "We're defending our initiative against the federal government because we're concerned that Jeff Sessions will try to overturn our local laws here," he told CNN on Wednesday. "We're being proactive to share marijuana, which is our right, before it's too late. We also want to educate Trump supporters that we can do this legally." Eidinger is the founder of DCMJ, an organization that worked to pass Initiative 71, which legalized marijuana in Washington. Initiative 71 made it legal for anyone to carry up to two ounces of marijuana in the nation's capitol. But it can only be gifted -- it's not legal to sell it. Protesters who are willing are also planning to light their joint on the National Mall four minutes and 20 seconds into Trump's presidency (420 is a code-term that refers to the consumption of weed). Eidinger is warning protestors who plan to smoke that it's illegal to do so on that property -- and are risking arrest. "If they do that on the National Mall, that's up to them," he said. "The National Mall is a place for protest. If it smells like marijuana, it's only one person's fault -- and that person is Donald Trump." Trump has remained mum on the issue of marijuana. Eidinger said he'd be willing to call the event off if Trump reached out to him to talk about his organization. "If he's going to listen to us, then we have no choice than to stink up the inauguration with marijuana," he said. However, Sessions, Trump's pick for attorney general, has not kept his strong feelings against marijuana use a secret. "Good people don't smoke marijuana," the Alabama Republican senator Trump's team did not immediately respond to a request for comment by CNN. Eidinger said he's passionate about the legalization of the plant because of it's beneficial properties. "I've seen the healing power of the plant," he said. "I've seen so many people get better with marijuana use, whether it's (multiple sclerosis), or cancer or AIDS. I think it's a great injustice to put people in jail for something so benign and so beneficial." "I've seen the healing power of the plant," he said.

"Let's stare this reality square in the face: PEOTUS is pro-Putin and believes Julian Assange over the @CIA. On Jan. 20 we will be less safe," tweeted George Little, who served under former President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama. Trump has repeatedly questioned and dismissed the intelligence community's conclusion that the Russian government was behind election-related hacking. Despite not trusting their findings, the intelligence community is the main body Trump will rely on for security advice as head of state. Trump also tweeted intelligence officials postponed an "'intelligence' briefing on so-called 'Russian hacking'" that they were set to deliver to him this week because they might need more time "to build a case." He called the move "very strange." The consensus in the Obama administration and the uniform opinion of the US intelligence community is that the Russian government was involved, but Assange said in an interview Tuesday that he does not believe that is clear and that Wikileaks didn't get the hacked info it published from the Russians. Trump turned the blame on the Democratic National Committee. "Julian Assange said "a 14 year old could have hacked Podesta" - why was DNC so careless? Also said Russians did not give him the info," Trump tweeted Wednesday. Assange told Fox News' Sean Hannity in an interview that aired Tuesday that WikiLeaks' source for the material he hacked was not "Russia or anyone associated with Russia." "Our source is not a state party. So the answer -- for our interactions -- is no," said Assange from his quarters at the Ecuadorean embassy in London, where he has lived under diplomatic protection since 2012.

West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin will skip the meeting, designed to unify the party against repeal of the Affordable Care Act, arguing in an interview with CNN that it would only serve to poison any efforts for bipartisanship in the new Congress. Manchin has always been somewhat of a thorn in the Obama administration's side - and as a Democrat running for re-election in 2018 in a state President-elect Donald Trump won by 42 percentage points, there was no question that would continue. But his willingness to skip the meeting underscores that Capitol Hill Democrats aren't entirely unified in their opposition. Manchin was also critical of Vice President-elect Mike Pence's dueling visit with Capitol Hill Republicans, saying it would have a similar effect to Obama's - especially so soon after the start of the new Congress. "Just the second day up here, can you imagine?" Manchin asked. Senate Republicans have already started the process to repeal Obama's signature health care law, the Affordable Care act, a cornerstone of his domestic achievements, and the debate is expected to start on that effort as soon as today. But it's being done through a process called reconciliation, which will allow Republicans to repeal large swaths of the law with just 51 votes, as opposed to the 60 it would traditionally take to move legislation in the chamber. That, Manchin said, is a problem for the Democrats - he said he's identified around ten - who stand willing to work with Republicans to make changes to the law. While Manchin said he'll work across the aisle, taking a purely partisan path to repeal and expecting Democratic help - which the GOP will need - is likely to push other likeminded Democrats further away from negotiations, he predicted. More importantly, he said, it would also put the onus entirely - and immediately - on the GOP to ensure limited or no disruptions in coverage. "You break it, you own it," Manchin said. In separate interview Wednesday afternoon, Manchin told CNN he's hoping to speak with Vice President-elect Mike Pence soon specifically on the issue of how to replace Obamacare. "They're trying to tell us, just vote to repeal," Manchin said on Capitol Hill, just hours after Pence spoke to reporters following his meeting with GOP senators. "I can't do that. And I've not seen a replacement. I've been here for six years and haven't seen a replacement yet. So I would like to see what's, you know. I know that Vice President Pence, he basically expanded Medicaid protection, Medicaid expansion in Indiana. How can you expand it on one hand, and have to go back and say we're repealing it."

Watch the full clip here: Watch the full clip here: ©Liberal groups are holding standing-room-only meetings to prepare for the confirmation hearings of Sen. Jeff Sessions for attorney general, but many in the room believe the battle will be a dry run for a much bigger fight: the confirmation of Donald Trump's eventual Supreme Court nominee. The hearings to fill the ninth seat on the bench will center around the testimony of someone who will likely cement a conservative majority on the high court for years to come. The groups are now working on an unfamiliar playing field -- without the anchor of a Democratic President. They are laying the groundwork for a major fight and hoping that the new ranking member of the Judiciary Committee -- California Sen. Dianne Feinstein -- will lead that fight. "We are not going to settle on a Supreme Court nominee," Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told MSNBC on Tuesday night. "If they don't appoint someone who's really good, we're going to oppose him tooth and nail." Democrats are also preparing to put Republicans on trial for the way they handled President Barack Obama's nominee, Merrick Garland. Liberal groups believe that when Republicans blocked hearings for Garland, they set a new precedent forever changing Supreme Court confirmation hearings. And they refer to the seat that Trump is about to fill as the "stolen seat." On Tuesday, White House spokesman Josh Earnest warned that the fallout from the Garland fight would extend to future presidents. "That breakdown of comity in the United States Senate, that abdication of the basic responsibility of members of the Unites States Senate, by subjecting it to such intense partisanship and actually allowing partisanship, to supersede the constitutional obligation, it's discouraging," Earnest told reporters. "It's a precedent that I think Republicans will regret setting." Garland's nomination may have lapsed, but for his supporters, the wounds are fresh. "Folks know that Republicans stole this seat and are extraordinarily disinclined to let them get away with it," said Drew Courtney, spokesman for the People for the American Way. Courtney says that anyone on Trump's list of 21 potential Supreme Court nominees will provoke a big fight and that Republicans are mistaken if they believe that Democrats would accept someone off a "wish list" compiled by conservative groups such as the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation. "Everyone understands that the stakes are enormous," he said. It was back in 2013 when then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, frustrated by Republican efforts to block lower court nominees, changed the rules and lowered the threshold to overcome a filibuster from 60 to 51 votes. Supreme Court nominees were exempt from the rules change and are still subject to the higher vote threshold. In his interview with MSNBC, Schumer signaled a hardline: that unless Trump nominated a "mainstream" candidate, Democrats might force Republicans to consider a rules change for Supreme Court nominees. Schumer said the Republicans may not have the 60 votes "to put in an out of the mainstream nominee, and then they will have to make a choice: change the rules. It's going to be very hard for them to change the rules, because there are a handful of Republicans who believe in the institution of the Senate and don't change the rules." Pressed on whether he'd work to hold the seat open, he replied, "Absolutely." Republicans, meanwhile, praise Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for following through with a promise to allow the "people" to choose Antonin Scalia's replacement after the election and they say every name on Trump's list of 21 is eminently qualified to take the bench. Most of all, they are keenly aware of the stakes and are committed to ensuring that the new nominee might become Trump's most lasting legacy. To be sure, while Trump's other nominees could serve for four years -- or even eight -- his Supreme Court nominee could spend decades on the bench. Justice Anthony Kennedy, for example, was placed on the bench six presidents ago. "Donald Trump will pick from his excellent list of principled and highly qualified candidates who are committed to an interpretation of the Constitution as it was written," said Carrie Severino of the conservative Judicial Confirmation Network. Trump ally Newt Gingrich rejects the notion that the Sessions hearings will impact the Supreme Court fight one way or another. "First of all, I think Sessions will be fine -- most of the attacks on him are just false," Gingrich said Tuesday Gingrich added he thought that Trump would not stray from the list of 21 potential nominees he released during the campaign. "I believe he has a moral obligation to name somebody who literally is on the list and was released in the campaign," he said. It was during the campaign that Scalia suddenly died and the White House put forward Garland, whom the President called a consensus candidate. Progressive groups supported the pick vigorously even though some had hoped for a different candidate who might have done more to rally the base. Throughout the spring they ran a campaign called #WENEEDNINE to push for hearings. By summer, Garland's name was no longer a headline. But progressives hope that will change in the next few weeks. "This is a moment in time for the broadest possible coalition of groups to go out to their members, affiliates and supporters to talk about the importance of the Supreme Court," said Nan Aron of the progressive Alliance for Justice. "In the background lurks this very fixed idea that we are looking at a stolen seat, a seat that should have been filled by an Obama nominee who was forward looking not backward in his view of the Constitution," she said. But building a coalition will be complicated and could take careful choreography. Unlike confirmation battles for a typical cabinet post, there are a variety of issues at stake and diverse perspectives. They include the hot button issues -- abortion rights, voting laws, environmental regulations, union rules, campaign finance, gun control --that often closely divide the high court. Christopher Kang, the National Director of the National Council of Asian Pacific Americans, has attended the meetings in preparation for the Sessions hearings and says it has been an important exercise for the groups to react without a package of material they might have come from the White House during the Obama administration. "This time it is up to us to build the record," he said. Sen. Patrick Leahy, a veteran of confirmation battles for years, is no longer the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, having moved over to Appropriations. Feinstein will take the helm, bringing with her some new staff. Progressives note that Feinstein was quick to act when Sessions left off some key information -- his failed nomination as a federal judge -- when he submitted his first questionnaire. She fired off a letter directly to Sessions asking him for more information. In a statement, she did not ask for a delay in the Sessions hearings but asked Chairman Grassley to join a request for information she felt was missing. "I am sure you would agree that staff must have sufficient time to do the due diligence on any nominee for this vital position," she wrote. But some progressives are concerned that she might work differently from Leahy. They were surprised, for instance, in 2007 when she voted in favor of Judge Leslie Southwick a nominee of George W. Bush for the 5th Circuit. But Feinstein voted against Bush's nominees to the Supreme Court, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito. For now, before a nominee is announced, Elizabeth Wydra of the progressive Constitutional Accountability Center says that the "unprecedented" behavior of Senate Republicans last year "severely undermined bedrock norms of constitutional government." "Now that Republicans are in control, they could take a first step in repairing some of the damage they inflicted by nominating a consensus candidate, in the mold of Garland," she said. ©Sen. Lindsey Graham said Wednesday it will be difficult for him to support President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet nominees if they don't accept US intelligence on Russia's alleged hacking in the 2016 election. "I'm looking for people who understand the world as it is," he said on CNN's "At this Hour." "If a nominee for a critical job doesn't understand what the Russians are up to, I'll have a hard time believing they have the judgment to do their job." Lawmakers have expressed concern about the relationship between Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson and Russia, given his involvement with the country while he was heading ExxonMobil. Russian President Vladimir Putin awarded Tillerson the Order of Friendship, one of the highest honors Russia gives to foreign citizens. Graham said if Tillerson rejects the intelligence pointing to Russia's involvement, he might not get the lawmaker's support. "He'll have a hard time getting my vote because it's clear," Graham said. "You don't have to be Sherlock Holmes." Graham said he's "perplexed" that Trump sees other foreign threats for what they are but not those from Russia. "What bothers me is that President-elect Trump seems to get the Chinese for what they are. The Iranian agreement is bad. He gets that. He understands the threat we face from ISIL," Graham said, using another common acronym for ISIS. "When it comes to Russia, he seems to have a blind spot, and I'm completely perplexed because the Russians are undermining democracy through the entire world." If Trump doesn't respond to the Russians appropriately, other countries may feel emboldened to hack the US in future elections -- and this time it might be the Republicans on the receiving end, Graham said. "Sanctions are coming, President-elect Trump. I hope you will after Friday understand that the Russians did interfere in our election," he said, referring to the day Trump is expected to receive an intel briefing on the hacking. "They did they did release information embarrassing to the Democratic party. It did affect Hillary Clinton." "It could happen to the Republicans in the next election by Iran or China if you don't push back now," Graham added.

"Make no mistake about it," Pence told reporters after meeting with GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill. "We're going to keep our promise to the American people -- we're going to repeal Obamacare and replace it with solutions that lower the cost of health insurance without growing the size of government." At the same time President Barack Obama was huddled with House Democrats across the Capitol -- urging them not to "rescue" the GOP by giving them a few votes to help pass "something worse" -- Pence was instructing Republicans to argue they are only trying to clean up Democrats' mess. Pence, who was a congressman before serving as Indiana's governor, recalled his time in the House and accused Democrats of breaking the promises made at the time. "The reality is that I was here in March of 2010 in another capacity when Obamacare was signed into law," Pence said alongside other GOP leaders including House Speaker Paul Ryan. "I remember all those promises. We were told that if you like your doctor, you can keep it. Not true." Pence and Speaker Ryan repeatedly dodged questions about the specifics of their plan to replace Obamacare. Ryan reiterated his vow they wouldn't "pull the rug out" from anyone, but declined to explain what people could expect to see as the GOP dismantles the current system and develops something to put in its place Pence told House Republicans that the Trump administration doesn't want -- or plan to have -- any coverage disruptions for the 20 million Americans insured through the Affordable Care Act as Congress works to repeal it and replace it with an alternative that has not yet been determined. The closed-door meetings with Pence and Obama both focused largely on how to sell the parties' approach to voters. Pence's meeting came as the President-elect tweeted -- in a reference to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer -- that the GOP shouldn't "let the Schumer clowns out of this web." Rep. Chris Collins, a New York Republican and Trump ally, said Pence would play a "lead role" and that Republicans need to have details on what they plan to do nailed down in time for insurers and the public to plan for changes. He said Republicans are eying the goal of having details of their Obamacare replacement in the form of a legislative proposal in six months. As Trump prepares to take office, Pence -- a 12-year veteran of Congress -- is becoming his liaison to Capitol Hill. Trump is even tapping Marc Short, a longtime Pence aide and Koch brothers operative, as his legislative adviser. Pence -- who will already have an office across the Capitol as president of the Senate -- will also have a House office. It's an unusual arrangement for a vice president, but one that underscores Pence's close ties to House Republican leaders with whom Trump has at times quarreled.

Less than three weeks out from leaving the White House, Obama visited Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill with a mission to save his signature healthcare reform law as Republicans are moving quickly to unroll the Affordable Care Act. In the closed-door meeting, the President urged fellow Democrats to not "rescue" Republicans by helping them pass replacement measures, according to sources in the room. He also floated this idea: Start referring to the GOP's new plan as "Trumpcare." The suggestion was a clear indication of the Democratic Party's goal of turning the tables on Republicans, who are already facing pressure to quickly craft a replacement bill. As he walked by a scrum of reporters, Obama would only say this about the Democratic Party's message: "Look out for the American people." After the meeting, a White House aide said Obama used "Trumpcare" as an indication he was open to Trump taking credit for improvements. The feisty remarks from the outgoing President came as Republicans also huddled on Capitol Hill Wednesday morning to chart their path forward repealing Obamacare. Vice President-elect Mike Pence visited with GOP lawmakers in what became a morning of dueling meetings on Day Two of the new Congress. Pence told reporters following the meeting: "Make no mistake about it: We're going to keep our promise to the American people -- we're going to repeal Obamacare and replace it with solutions that lower the cost of health insurance without growing the size of government." The public theater of the simultaneous meetings Wednesday was the clearest indication in the new year that Obamacare will be an all-consuming and deeply contentious political fight under the next president, Donald Trump. With Republicans about to control the House, Senate and the White House, Democrats are strategizing on ways to pressure the GOP against rolling back the law -- and ensuring the Republicans are held responsible for any disruptions in health coverage. (Following their meeting, Democratic lawmakers started to push the phrase: "Make America Sick Again" -- a play on Trump's campaign slogan, "Make America Great Again.") Republicans, meanwhile, have the massive task of figuring out how to replace what they repeal. Republican members leaving the meeting with Pence said the gathering felt like a "pep rally" but that there were not many policy details discussed. According to GOP Rep. Chris Collins, the party is eyeing the goal of crafting a replacement proposal in six months. Pence, who was a congressman before serving as Indiana's governor, recalled his time in the House and accused Democrats of breaking the promises made at the time. "The reality is that I was here in March of 2010 in another capacity when Obamacare was signed into law," Pence said alongside other GOP leaders including House Speaker Paul Ryan. "I remember all those promises. We were told that if you like your doctor, you can keep it. Not true." Both Ryan and Pence promised a "careful" replacement of the law, trying to assuage concerns that a straight repeal of Obamacare would leave many including those with pre-existing conditions without healthcare. The benefits of Obamacare was something the President emphasized in his meeting with Democrats, according to Rep. Maxine Waters, and argued that the country largely likes the law and that he has received countless letters thanking him for Obamacare. Another lawmaker in the room said the mood among Democrats was "fired up." "In two weeks I will no longer be a politician, but I'll still be a citizen. I envy you so much right now, because I would love to be on the field," Obama said, according to the member. Some lawmakers on Tuesday questioned the wisdom of planning clashing meetings, each designed to advance a partisan agenda. "Any type of a meeting that we have that's not bipartisan is not in the proper scheme of things of starting out the new year," said Sen. Joe Manchin, the moderate Democrat from West Virginia, who said he would skip the Obama meeting. "It's just not a good situation for us to be in. So if Mr. Pence is coming up here only to speak to Republicans and President Obama's coming here only to speak to Democrats, I would be concerned about that. Because I don't know how you change anything -- how do you change anything unless we all come together?" Republicans have long vowed to get rid of Obamacare, voting on dozens of measures that would repeal the law. Those attempts were largely theatre; there was never a scenario in which Obama himself would approve the repeal of his own landmark legislative accomplishment. Trump made getting rid of the law a key element of his campaign strategy. He said on Twitter Tuesday that Obamacare provided "lousy healthcare." With Trump headed for the Oval Office, and Republicans controlling both houses of Congress, the prospects for a successful repeal now appear more realistic. On Tuesday, Senate Republicans took their first steps toward repealing Obamacare, filing a budget resolution reversing key elements of the law. There remain divisions, however, on which precise elements of the law to scrap, and how to replace Obamacare with a law that doesn't strip Americans of their health insurance. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, wrote in an op-ed Tuesday that lawmakers shouldn't vote on repealing Obamacare until a replacement plan was developed. "If Congress fails to vote on a replacement at the same time as repeal, the repealers risk assuming the blame for the continued unraveling of Obamacare. For mark my words, Obamacare will continue to unravel and wreak havoc for years to come," he wrote. And Trump's campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, who's been tapped to serve as his senior counselor at the White House, said Tuesday that passing repeal and replacement measures simultaneously would be "the ideal situation." "We don't want anyone who currently has insurance to not have insurance," Conway said on MSNBC, adding there "are some pieces of merit in the current plan." ©The Trump transition began its outreach to the African-American community Wednesday afternoon with an event billed as a "listening session" in Washington, led by former Apprentice contestant Omarosa Manigault. Manigault, newly tapped by President-elect Donald Trump to work on public engagement in the White House, was joined by other transition officials, including domestic policy chair Ken Blackwell and senior adviser Katrina Pierson. About 100 leaders from a variety of African-American organizations, ranging from the NAACP to fraternities and sororities, were in attendance for the meeting, which lasted more than two hours and was closed to press. Bishop Harry Jackson, a conservative activist and evangelical leader, called the meeting a "starting point" for members of the community to discuss their priorities and state their agenda, praising the Trump transition's "openness" to listening. "You have an outsider and an outside team. They're not going to do business as usual, they don't even know how to spell business as usual. For that reason, I'm optimistic," Jackson said, calling the meeting's atmosphere "very civil" and "a very sophisticated meet-and-greet." Hilary O. Shelton, NAACP Washington Bureau director and senior vice president for advocacy and policy, said the meeting "could be a great start." "What happens at this point is in the hands of the administration," Shelton added. Multiple attendees praised Manigault, calling her "very impressive" and "a great leader," noting that she asked follow-up questions, particularly about data and resources. "It was clear that she is going to help keep some of the promises of the Trump campaign and bring those forward to be actual actions in the Trump administration," said Johnny Taylor, Jr., president and CEO of the Thurgood Marshall College Fund. "I think we're going to see some major strides in issues that matter most to our community." The outreach comes after a less-than-warm reception for Trump from the African-American community during the election. In a September church visit in Flint, Michigan, an African-American pastor interrupted Trump for getting too political when he started to attack opponent Hillary Clinton. Other attendees heckled the then-candidate. Trump later went after the pastor, calling her "a nervous mess" on Fox News. On the campaign trail, Trump often described conditions in the black community in bleak terms, vowing to be a champion for African-Americans. "The violence. The death. The lack of education. No jobs. We're going to work with the African-American community and we're going to solve the problem of the inner city," he said days before the election in Toledo, Ohio. "We're going to bring safety back. You can't walk out the street, you buy a loaf of bread and you end up getting shot. So we're going to work very strongly with the African-American community." But Trump ultimately won just 8% of black voters, compared to 88% for Clinton. Now, as the incoming administration prepares for inauguration, leaders are keeping an open mind. "We want to see them move on issues that are important to the communities we serve. We want to make sure they recognize who we are and the conditions our communities are in," NAACP's Shelton said.

Some Republicans are cautioning against repealing the Affordable Care Act too quickly and urging the party take the foot off the accelerator. The reason: there's no plan on how to replace what they roll back. And while GOP lawmakers are eager to please their base with headlines of Obamacare's repeal, they don't want to be blamed for leaving people without health insurance and chaos in the healthcare market. Sen. John McCain told reporters Tuesday that he supports taking a slower approach to repealing the law, saying he is "always worried about something that took a long time in the making and we've got to concentrate our efforts to making sure that we do it right so that nobody's left out." Newt Gingrich, the former Republican House Speaker and a close ally of President-elect Donald Trump, told CNN that a big risk for Republicans is getting blamed for taking away people's health coverage. "Number one thing (Republicans) have to avoid is putting themselves in a position where Democrats can frighten people -- that somehow, they won't have access to health care because of Republicans," Gingrich said. Gingrich stressed that before Republicans send a bill repealing Obamacare to Trump's desk, the party must make real progress on a replacement plan. "They have to have bridges to give people a sense of comfort that they're not going to be abandoned," he said. GOP Sen. Rand Paul cited potential insurance market problems if the law isn't replaced when it is repealed. "If Congress fails to vote on a replacement at the same time as repeal, the repealers risk assuming the blame for the continued unraveling of Obamacare," These initial hints of anxiety from Republicans foreshadow an internal GOP tug-of-war on Obamacare in the coming weeks. For now, party leaders are leaning towards a repeal bill that includes a two- or three-year transition period that would offer a buffer -- a strategy that has been dubbed "repeal and delay." House and Senate Republicans both But healthcare experts warn that even if the repeal doesn't go into effect right away, the uncertainty could lead to insurance companies fleeing the marketplace and potentially putting millions of people's coverage at risk. In a clear effort to counter some of the early criticism, leaders of the conservative House Republican Study Committee plan to unveil legislation on Wednesday that they argue would both repeal and replace Obamacare. The bill was previously introduced by GOP Rep. Phil Roe, a physician, and has not been endorsed by leadership. While it is unlikely to emerge as the main Obamacare repeal bill in the House, it marks an effort by conservatives to push back on the suggestion that the party has no replacement plan. All of this comes as Democrats are pouncing on the opportunity to turn the tables on Republicans. Lawmakers are planning a PR blitz throughout the month of January, accusing Republicans for possibly putting millions of Americans' health coverage in jeopardy. Sen. Joe Manchin, a moderate Democrat from West Virginia, warned that repeal and delay approach would result in a "chaotic" scene. "I'm just going to caution again, my friends: Don't repeal this unless there's a bipartisan group," Manchin said. "And if you don't have anything to replace it with, don't put repeal on the board." "It's the old thing of going into a china shop -- you break it, you own it," Pelosi said. Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein told CNN on Tuesday that she is in the process of crafting counter-messaging on Obamacare, along the lines of: "Look at what this is going to do to people." "That's the important thing," she said. "How many people are going to lose their healthcare?" ©He may have a $181 million retirement package and $54 million of ExxonMobil shares, but even secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson shops for his own Raisin Bran. The longtime ExxonMobil CEO was spotted at a Safeway supermarket Tuesday evening in Washington's Dupont Circle neighborhood. "Yup. That's Rex Tillerson in my local Safeway shopping like a plebeian," Washingtonian Sanho Tree wrote in a tweet that has since gone viral. "His security guy is about 20 paces behind him." The accompanying photo shows Tillerson in the canned goods and pasta aisle, toting a basket filled with Raisin Bran cereal, milk and baby carrots, among other groceries. The grocery store in question is (affectionately) known by locals as the "Soviet Safeway," Tree said in another tweet. "Long lines, bad selection!" There is no parking and the small store lacks the selection of larger supermarkets nearby, such as the sprawling "Social Safeway" in Georgetown. Ironically, the high-profile "Soviet Safeway" shopper is known for his close business ties to Russia, having received the "Order of Friendship" from Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2013. Many GOP senators, including John McCain, have expressed concern over Tillerson's relationship with Russia. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, who will oversee Tillerson's confirmation hearings, said Wednesday he expects the nominee to lead a robust policy toward Russia. "I had a long private conversion with him. I had talked to him on the phone prior to that," said Corker. "I think what people are going to find when they hear Tillerson in the hearing is that he's very, very much in the mainstream of US foreign policy thinking."

The Talladega College Marching Tornadoes band was among 40 organizations that accepted an invitation to take part in the inaugural parade after the January 20 swearing in, according to an initial list released Friday by Trump's inaugural committee. The possibility that the band from the College President Billy C.

But another school official, spokeswoman Veronica Clark-Holland, told CNN late Wednesday that any decision was unlikely to be announced during the evening. Clark-Holland said Hawkins had been meeting with board members all day, but no decision had been reached. Hawkins was scheduled to appear Wednesday on "CNN Tonight" with Don Lemon, but canceled the appearance. A petition started by "In view of his behavior and comments I strongly do not want Talladega College to give the appearance of supporting him," she wrote. The petition had more than 900 supporters by Tuesday night. Trump has made what many view as disparaging comments about people of color, including saying that Mexico was sending its worst citizens over the border. "Some are good and some are rapists and some are killers. We don't even know what we're getting," he said in 2015. Trump has also used the word "The violence. The death. The lack of education. No jobs. We're going to work with the African-American community and we're going to solve the problem of the inner city," he said in 2016. "We're going to bring safety back. You can't walk out on the street, you buy a loaf of bread and you end up getting shot." In the second petition, Talladega student and band member Young wrote that taking part in the inaugural would not be in support of a political party, but rather "about the experience that the students will obtain." His petition had garnered close to 200 signatures by Tuesday night. Another band member, Shylexis Robinson, told CNN affiliate WVTM she was excited and felt the performance would "put our school on the map." Robinson said it wasn't "about Donald Trump himself, it's about our school. And I'm all about our school and all about the band." Edna Garrett, of Talladega, told WVTM that being associated with Trump and negativity surrounding him wouldn't benefit Talladega. "I don't really see how it would uplift the school in any way," she said. Talladega College, founded in 1867, is Alabama's oldest private historically black liberal arts college, according to the school's website. It's band, though, is relatively young. Wilson said the 297-member band started in 2012 and recently performed in New Orleans at the halftime show for a National Football League game between the New Orleans Saints and the Denver Broncos. One artist invited to perform at Trump's festivities has said she would do so -- with one requirement. This week, The song protested racism and addressed lynching in the South. It was made famous by the late Billie Holiday, a renowned jazz musician. In a statement posted to Ferguson's Twitter account Monday night, she said the song "has huge historical importance, a song that was blacklisted in the United States for being too controversial. A song that speaks to all the disregarded and downtrodden black people in the United States. A song that is a reminder of how love is the only thing that will conquer all the hatred in this world, then I will graciously accept your invitation and see you in Washington. Best Rebecca X." The lyrics, written in the 1930s by Jewish communist Abel Meeropol, were composed as a protest poem to highlight racism in America's southern states. The song's opening lyrics are: "Southern trees bear strange fruit / Blood on the leaves and blood at the root /Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze / Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees." The inaugural committee has announced three acts so far: the Radio City Rockettes, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and 16-year-old "America's Got Talent" star Jackie Evancho. But there still is controversy surrounding the group of committed performers. A member of the Mormon choir, which has performed at five presidential inaugurations, quit.

A Democratic source with knowledge of Periello's plans confirmed them to CNN. A second senior Democratic source said Perriello has informed Lt. Governor Ralph Northam, up until now the only announced candidate, of his intention to run. Perriello confirmed his bid Thursday morning, tweeting: "I'm running for Governor. VA will remain the firewall vs Trump- our values worth defending: http://tomforvirginia.com." Perriello's plans complicate the Democrats' strategy in Virginia, a state with likely the most important political contest in 2017. Only two states, Virginia and New Jersey, will hold governor's races this year and the results are often viewed as a way to judge voters' impressions of the newly elected presidential administration. Democrats had thought they had avoided an ugly primary battle when the state's popular attorney general, Mark Herring, chose to run for re-election instead of challenging Northam in a primary. Perriello's entry creates an interesting dynamic. He served one term in the conservative, sprawling 5th District of Central Virginia before being swept out of office in the tea party wave of 2010. His two years were spent balancing his liberal politics with the conservative sensibilities of the largely rural district, which does include the progressive enclave of Charlottesville. He sided with conservatives on key issues such as guns (he once received the endorsement of the National Rifle Association) and abortion (he cast a ballot in favor the Stupak amendment which prevents federal funds from being used to pay for abortions). But Perriello ended his 2010 campaign in a liberal flourish, even bringing President Barack Obama to the district for a dramatic rally in the closing days of the campaign. He lost by 4 percentage points. Perriello is viewed as a progressive champion among Virginia Democrats, while Northam is viewed as a more traditional, moderate Virginia Democrat. Born and raised in the state's Eastern Shore, Northam was a prep school baseball star before attending the famed Virginia Military Institute and then eventually becoming a pediatric neurosurgeon. He also served in the Virginia Senate and was known for his ability to work with both sides, but had a reliably liberal voting record, especially when it came to abortion rights. Meanwhile, Perriello has spent his years out of public office working for a liberal think tank in Washington before accepting an assignment as the Obama administration's Special Envoy to the Great Lakes region of Africa. Both men have relatively low profiles when it comes to statewide Virginia politics, but Northam certainly starts the race with an enormous head start. He has already raised millions of dollars and has spent the last year criss-crossing the state as the presumptive Democratic nominee. He also still enjoys the support of most of Virginia's prominent Democrats including both senators, Mark Warner and Tim Kaine, and Gov. Terry McAuliffe. Aides to the two senators and the governor confirmed to CNN they will stick with the Northam regardless of Perriello's entry into the race. This new development could be good news for Virginia Republicans, who are already anticipating their own bruising primary. Their contest could be the first major inter-party battle for the GOP since Donald Trump's surprise win in the race for president. Former George W. Bush aide Ed Gillespie is considered the frontrunner, but he is facing a feisty challenge from a slew of candidates including, Corey Stewart the former Virginia Campaign Chairman for Trump, State Sen.

The secretary general said he is looking forward to engaging with the President-elect after the inauguration, according to deputy spokesman Farhan Haq, who described the introductory call as a "very positive discussion on US and UN relations." Trump has expressed mixed views on the UN. After the UN Security Council's recent vote to to condemn Israeli settlements in the West Bank, the President-elect tweeted, "The United Nations has such great potential.

"Nobody wants to get off on the wrong foot with the new boss. We're heading into this different era where it's hostile," one official said. Another official added, "It's a sad day when politicians place more stock in (Russian President Vladimir Putin and (WikiLeaks founder) Julian Assange than in the Americans who risk their lives daily to provide objective, non-partisan intelligence analysis." That was a reference to Trump's tweet on Wednesday noting that Assange said he Adding to the concern, officials said there is a disconnect between Trump's US officials familiar with the briefings said Trump is for the most part professional, deferential and polite. He listens but does not engage frequently during the briefings, other officials said, although at times he has challenged and questioned information. A senior transition source told CNN that Trump does ask questions, adding, "Questions are good." The transition official said the President-elect does not question the data presented to him but he does question some of the conclusions drawn from the data. US officials said the alleged election hacks and Russia have come up in briefings with Trump, but the full picture of what all the different intelligence threads mean has not been presented to him yet. That will happen during a briefing that is scheduled Friday with leaders of the intelligence community. As officials try to make sense of Trump's skepticism, one theory is that the President-elect is acting out because he believes that the intelligence community is trying to undermine his victory with information that Russia tried to affect the 2016 vote. "The intelligence community is not saying that Vladimir Putin won the election for Trump," the official said. "We're saying they did a series of things to sow doubt and some people think they wanted Trump to win, but no one has ever said they got into the mechanics of the ballot boxes."

Here's the latest schedule: ©President-elect Donald Trump's transition team has signaled to congressional Republican leaders that his preference is to fund the border wall through the appropriations process as soon as April, according to House Republican officials. The move would break a key campaign promise when Trump repeatedly said he would force Mexico to pay for the construction of the wall along the border, though in October, Trump suggested for the first time that Trump defended that proposal Friday morning in a tweet, saying the move to use congressional appropriations was because of speed. "The dishonest media does not report that any money spent on building the Great Wall (for sake of speed), will be paid back by Mexico later!" Trump tweeted Friday. New York Rep. Chris Collins said Friday that American taxpayers would front the cost for the wall but that he was confident Trump could negotiate getting the money back from Mexico. "When you understand that Mexico's economy is dependent upon US consumers, Donald Trump has all the cards he needs to play," Collins, congressional liaison for the Trump transition team, told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on "New Day." "On the trade negotiation side, I don't think it's that difficult for Donald Trump to convince Mexico that it's in their best interest to reimburse us for building the wall." The Trump team argues it will have the authority through a Bush-era 2006 law to build the wall, lawmakers say, but it lacks the money to do so. Transition officials have told House GOP leaders in private meetings they'd like to pay for the wall in the funding bill, a senior House GOP source said. "It was not done in the Obama administration, so by funding the authorization that's already happened a decade ago, we could start the process of meeting Mr. Trump's campaign pledge to secure the border," Indiana Republican Rep. Luke Messer said on Thursday. Messer admitted it's "big dollars, but it's a question of priorities." He pointed to a border security bill that Homeland Security Chairman Mike McCaul proposed last year that cost roughly $10 billion. "Democrats may well find themselves in the position to shut down all of government to stop the buildout of a wall, or of a barrier, or of a fence," Messer said. Mexican leaders have repeatedly said they will not pay for the wall. If Mexico refuses to pay for the wall, the GOP could add billions of dollars into the spending bill that needs to pass by April 28 to keep the government open. But doing so would force a showdown with Senate Democrats and potentially threaten a government shutdown. No decisions have been made, GOP sources said. Republicans point out that then-Sen. Barack Obama, Sen. Chuck Schumer and then-Sen. Hillary Clinton voted for the 2006 bill and argued that since Democrats backed that bill, they should support efforts to fund the current effort. The thinking behind the strategy is that it is harder for Democrats to filibuster spending bills because of the high stakes involved if they fail to pass in time. Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 3 Republican in the House leadership, declined to say Thursday if Congress would pay for the wall. "We want President Trump to have all the tools he needs to build the wall," Scalise said. "We're in talks with him on the details of it as they're still putting together their team. We still got a few months before there's another funding bill that's going to move. We're going to work with him to make sure we can get it done. We want to build a wall. He wants to build a wall." Trump himself has estimated his border wall would cost $8 billion, though other analysts have estimated the price A major challenge for judging Trump's proposal is that most of those steps amount to a drop in the bucket -- less than $1 billion -- compared to the proposed cost of the wall. And the one step that could provide the required amount of money -- remittance seizure -- would face major legal obstacles, in addition to the likelihood of severe domestic and international backlash. Total US foreign aid to Mexico is less than $200 million a year ( Moving next to fee increases, Trump says on his website that "even a small increase in visa fees would pay for the wall. This includes fees on border crossing cards, of which more than 1 million are issued a year." But the fees for visas and border crossing cards range from around $150 to $200 each, according to State Department data. Accounting for all the fees on over a million border crossing cards and visas in a year year -- and even accounting for a twofold increase in those fees -- that would still only generate about half a billion dollars, well short of an $8 billion price tag. The biggest potential source of money for the wall would come from remittance seizure: remittance payments are money that immigrants, legal and illegal, earn in their country of residence and send back to their families in their native country. According to the bank of Mexico, Mexico received $24.8 billion in Trump says on his website that he would use the Patriot Act to require legal identification for money transfer transactions, according to his website. But CNN legal analyst Paul Callan says Trump's plan would likely face multiple legal battles. "The Mexican immigrants Trump seeks to target are clearly not the 'Radical Islamic Terrorists' that the Patriot Act was designed to fight," says Callan. "The courts are likely to view Mr. Trump's use of the always controversial Patriot Act as an improper and illegal use. The proposal may also fail to place pressure on the Mexican government as money can be smuggled back to Mexico in many other creative ways if wire transfers are cut." The size of Mexico's remittance revenue far surpasses any other revenue-raising proposal from Trump, and would probably be the most effective way to pay for the border wall. But looking at the obstacles that such an action would face, it's difficult to envision a path to impounding those payments to pay for the wall. ©President-elect Donald Trump has tapped former Sen. Dan Coats of Indiana to serve as director of national intelligence, transition sources confirmed on Thursday. Coats, who retired from the Senate this month after deciding not to seek re-election last year, would become Trump's principal adviser on intelligence matters and would oversee US intelligence efforts should he be confirmed by the Senate. He will not be present at an intelligence briefing for Trump on Friday, a transition source told CNN. Coats previously served in the US Senate from 1989 until 1999 before becoming the US ambassador to Germany in the first term of President George W. Bush's administration. He then returned to the Senate after winning election in 2010. Coats would step into the role at a time when US intelligence efforts are being intensely scrutinized amid the US intelligence community's conclusions that Russia hacked Democratic Party groups and individuals -- conclusions Trump has repeatedly dismissed. Coats' selection also coincides with reports that the Trump transition is considering ways to limit the power of the director of national intelligence, which some advisers to the President-elect believe gets in the way of the 16 intelligence agencies it represents. Sean Spicer, the incoming White House press secretary, stressed on a call with reporters Thursday morning that "all transition activities are for information gathering purposes and all discussions are tentative" as he pushed back on those reports. "The President-elect's top priority will be to ensure the safety of the American people and the security of the nation and he is committed to finding the best and most effective way to do it. But I want to reiterate, there is no truth to this idea of restructuring the intelligence community infrastructure, it is 100% false," he said. Sen. Angus King, an independent who usually caucuses with the Democrats, told CNN Thursday he was "impressed" with his Republican colleague. "He's not a fierce partisan," the Maine senator said. "He understand the intelligence community, as you know he was a US ambassador to Germany so he has that experience in foreign policy, and he's a very amiable, easy-to-work-with person, but I'm not as with all the other nominees, I'm going to wait until we have a hearing and go through the process. But he's a good solid citizen." ©Senate Democrats are calling on the House Office of Congressional Ethics to launch an investigation into Rep. Tom Price, President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for Health and Human Services secretary, to probe the congressman's financial investments and stock holdings. "We are here to call on the House Office of Congressional Ethics to investigate if any laws were broken," Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said at a news conference. "There's enough evidence here that cries out for an investigation. Whether the law was actually broken, whether there was quid pro quos or inside information is the better way to put it -- we don't know." Schumer was joined by fellow Democratic Sens. Patty Murray and Ron Wyden, each a top Democrat on two separate Senate committees set to hold confirmation hearings on Price. The announcement comes following a The senators are insisting that the House ethics panel investigate Price before his confirmation hearings begin. "The questions are serious enough that it raises this to a level that we believe an investigation must occur so that members -- Republicans and Democrats -- are confident that if this nomination moves forward, they're voting for someone that they clearly have the information on that we do not have today," Murray said. "We have a responsibility." Asked directly by CNN Wednesday if it was a mistake to trade in stocks in an industry he has oversight of, Price demurred, saying "I am looking forward to a very positive and productive confirmation hearing." Asked if he will answer that to the committee, Price said, "We will be happy to comply with whatever the senators want us to do." Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Missouri, a member of the GOP leadership the chairman of the panel that approves funding for HHS, told CNN said he didn't know the details of the allegations of Price but defended his former congressional colleague as a person of high integrity.

"As you know, Republicans backed off their crusade against ethics for now, but it begged the question: who are they trying to protect?" Schumer asked. The Trump transition said Democrats' call for an ethics probe into Price is "hypocrisy." "Hypocrisy is apparently alive and well this morning in Washington," transition spokesman Phil Blando said in a statement. "The same questions being raised today by Senator Schumer about Dr. Price should be directed to Senators Carper, Warner, and Whitehouse, who own and have traded hundreds of thousands of dollars in pharmaceutical and health insurance company stocks.

Trump sued Andres for breach of contract after the chef backed out of a plan for a restaurant in Trump's new luxury hotel in Washington. Andres claimed he canceled plans for the project after Trump made disparaging remarks about Mexican immigrants during his presidential campaign. Alan Garten, executive vice president and general counsel for Trump Organization, said the deposition lasted "just over one hour" and described the case as "fairly straightforward." "In short, the parties entered into a valid and enforceable lease, which the tenant clearly breached by walking out and failing to perform its obligations, thereby entitling the landlord to recover damages in the form of unpaid rent, cost of build out, lost profits and other expenses," Garten said in a statement. Neither Hicks nor Garten specified where the deposition took place but the President-elect has been in Trump Tower in New York all day Thursday. Trump's attorneys previously agreed to his deposition in New York, but sought to limit the length and scope of questioning, arguing in court filings that "Mr. Trump is not just any apex deponent; he is the President-elect ... It is not an overstatement that he is extremely busy handling matters of very significant public importance." But DC Superior Court Judge Jennifer A. Di Toro ©Fifteen days from his presidential inauguration, President-elect Donald Trump is looking to settle some scores. The President-elect spent part of his day Thursday dialing Ohio Republicans in the hopes of swaying their decision in Friday's vote for Ohio Republican Party chairman, according to a source familiar with the calls. Matt Borges, the current GOP chairman who was critical of Trump at times during the presidential campaign, is facing a challenge from prominent GOP donor Jane Timken. She's billed herself as the Trump-esque Republican in the race and drawn support from Bob Paduchik, who ran Trump's successful campaign trouncing Hillary Clinton in Ohio. The 66 elected members of the Ohio GOP's state central committee are slated to vote Friday morning -- and Trump is working the phones. Greg Simpson, a 66-year-old member of the state central committee, thought he was in for a pre-recorded message when his phone rang Thursday afternoon and a young woman said she was calling on behalf of Trump. "She said, 'Mr. Trump would like to have a few words with you.' At first I thought it was a recording, but it was him," Simpson said in a phone interview, chuckling as he recounted the conversation. "To be honest with you, I never thought that would happen in a million years," Simpson said, adding that he -- with Trump's permission -- put the incoming president on speakerphone for his colleagues to hear. "Everybody was like, 'Are you kidding me?' I was really surprised." A message left with the Trump transition team was not immediately returned. While Trump didn't offer up any disparaging words about Borges, he encouraged Simpson to vote for Timken and said it was time for a change in the state party leadership, Simpson said. Their exchange about the vote lasted 30 to 45 seconds. For the next four and a half minutes, they talked about everything else.

Despite the call, Simpson -- who voted for Trump for president -- said he's still likely to back Borges over Trump's pick in the battle for chairman. "The man did what he was supposed to do, which was get Republicans elected," Simpson said of Borges. Still, Simpson was clearly tickled by the personal attention from the President-elect. "At the very end I said 'I can't thank you enough for the phone call, I'm very flattered,'" Simpson said.

"The FBI repeatedly stressed to DNC officials the necessity of obtaining direct access to servers and data, only to be rebuffed until well after the initial compromise had been mitigated," a senior law enforcement official told CNN. "This left the FBI no choice but to rely upon a third party for information. These actions caused significant delays and inhibited the FBI from addressing the intrusion earlier." This statement is in response to reports that the FBI never asked the DNC for access to the hacked systems. The DNC told Buzzfeed News that they did not receive a request from the FBI to access their computer servers. "The DNC had several meetings with representatives of the FBI's Cyber Division and its Washington Field Office, the Department of Justice's National Security Division, and US Attorney's Offices, and it responded to a variety of requests for cooperation, but the FBI never requested access to the DNC's computer servers," Eric Walker, the DNC's deputy communications director, The FBI instead relied on the assessment from a third-party security company called CrowdStrIke. The DNC did not immediately respond to a request for comment by CNN.

President-elect Donald Trump is scheduled In a Fox News interview earlier this week, Meanwhile, US intelligence has received new information following the election that gave agencies increased confidence that Russia carried out the hack and did so, in part, to help Trump win. Included in that new information were intercepted conversations of Russian officials expressing happiness at Trump's win. Another official described some of the messages as congratulatory. Officials said this was just one of multiple indicators to give them high confidence of both Russian involvement and Russian intentions. Officials reiterated that there is no single intercepted communication that qualifies as a "smoking gun" on Russia's intention to benefit Trump's candidacy or to claim credit for doing so. A declassified public version of the Intelligence community's review of the election-related cyber hack will be released as soon as this afternoon, according to a US official. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi announced at a news conference Friday that the gang of eight congressional leaders were briefed before those members of the intelligence community went to New York to brief Trump. "Stunning in its conclusions and you will see some of it," Pelosi said. Vice President Joe Biden said in an interview with PBS NewsHour that an unclassified version of an intel report provided to him will be released "very shortly" and will "lay out in bold print what" the US knows about the hacking. "I think it will probably confirm what a lot of the American people think," he said, adding that it would "state clearly" the Russians involvement in the hacking. In response to the interview, Trump tweeted on Wednesday, "Julian Assange said "a 14 year old could have hacked Podesta" - why was DNC so careless? Also said Russians did not give him the info!"

In a statement, he formally announced he would no longer serve as an adviser to Trump. But he insisted in an interview with CNN's Erin Burnett that the move had nothing to do with his comments on Russia, only that he wanted to avoid any confusion about his role with Trump. Earlier this week, Woolsey told CNN's Jim Sciutto Woolsey insisted to Burnett Thursday that he was not leaving because he was frustrated with Trump's public dismissal of US intelligence findings. He said he had actually not advised Trump in some time and wanted to set the record straight on who he was and what he did. "I didn't want to fly under false colors," Woolsey said. "I'm not really functioning as an adviser anymore, and so when I'm on the screen, everybody announces that I'm former CIA director and that I'm a Trump adviser. And I'm really not anymore. So I just thought I should strike that from the (TV banner) ... so nobody was under false impressions." He said he still supported Trump and wished the incoming commander in chief well, but that he was not a part of his team anymore. He said there was no "particular point" that he had stopped advising Trump, but added he had only seen the President-elect in person a few times and talked on the phone "a little bit." "I didn't want to be claiming that I'm something I'm not," Woolsey said.

"He has been hostile to every community that DOJ is supposed to protect from discrimination," Indiana Democratic Rep. Andre Carson told reporters at a Capitol Hill news conference Thursday. A number of Senate Democrats have signaled they will oppose Sessions' nomination, but Republicans control the chamber and none have expressed any opposition. West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin has also praised Sessions and said he would vote for him, another factor indicating he is on track to serve as the next attorney general. Sarah Isgur Flores, a spokeswoman for Sessions, defended his record. "As attorney general-designate, Jeff Sessions has been endorsed by African-American and civil rights leaders who know him and know that he has has dedicated his career to upholding the law and ensuring public safety," Flores told CNN. "Those groups that want to score cheap political points by smearing his name do not have the facts on their side." Louisiana Democratic Rep. Cedric Richmond, who chairs the CBC, acknowledged the chances were slim that they'd be able to successfully derail his confirmation as attorney general. "None of our fights have ever been easy and we don't let the fact that it may be a longshot ever deter us and we are fighting for the justice of everyone in America," Richmond said. Thirty years ago, Sessions was nominated for a federal judgeship but during his Senate confirmation hearing he was Richmond, asked if he believed that Sessions was racist, didn't directly answer but said his "his beliefs are discriminatory, his actions are discriminatory." He added "if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, it's a duck." Multiple members of the black caucus pointed to concerns with Sessions' positions on voting rights, immigration and civil rights. They also took issue with his position on the Justice Department's role in addressing clashes between local communities and police departments. Sessions' supporters maintain that the Capitol Hill group does not speak for all African Americans and that the Alabama Republican has support from a number of black leaders.

"Nobody can predict what choices (the Trump) administration is going to make," Kerry told reporters Thursday. "I don't know, and I don't think you know." "I think the question a lot of people ask is, 'Do they know?' " he continued. "And we're going to have to wait and see what choices they make." But Kerry was emphatic in his support for President Barack Obama's foreign policy vision, and urged the country's future leadership to follow the same course. He defended, in particular, the international agreement he helped negotiate to curb Iran's nuclear program. That agreement, he insisted, "has made the world and our allies safer, including Israel and the Gulf states." To terminate it would leave the US with the same "bad choices" of accepting a nuclear Iran o getting involved in another Mideast conflictxc2xa0as before the deal was struck, he said. On addressing the "dire threat" of climate change, the secretary of state was equally emphatic, advocating for an agreement reached in Paris last year to cut global fossil fuel emissions. "I think it's safe to say that in terms of environmental diplomacy, the past year may have been the most productive in history," said Kerry, a vocal proponent of measures to stem climate change.xc2xa0 "We do not believe we can shift into reverse or even stop in this endeavor," he said. "This is a race against time." The secretary of state acknowledged some areas where the outgoing administration has fallen short in meeting its objectives, but nonetheless backed its approach. Despite his tireless efforts to secure a peace agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians early in his tenure, the efforts ultimately floundered. "The Israeli-Palestinian conflict continues," he said, "but we are absolutely right to support a two-state solution, and to warn about the danger of actions on any side that could obstruct that possibility." In an exit memorandum released Thursday, Kerry said that although he worked hard to restart negotiations between the two sides, "unfortunately, the parties were not willing to make the difficult choices necessary to move forward with the negotiations." In the memo,xc2xa0Kerry also highlighted progress toward degrading and destroying ISIS, as well as his own efforts to broker a ceasefirexc2xa0between Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and rebel forces to end their five-year war,xc2xa0"which has led to the worst humanitarian crisis since World War II."

Tim Kaine on Thursday criticized President-elect Donald Trump, alleging he is acting like Russian President Vladimir Putin's "defense lawyer" and calling Trump's conduct "suspicious." "Why does President-elect Trump again and again and again take it upon himself to be Vladimir Putin's defense lawyer rather than listening to and respecting the intelligence professionals of the United States," Kaine told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on "New Day" in his first national interview since the 2016 presidential election. The former Democratic vice presidential nominee, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee which is hold a hearing on hacking Thursday, said that even if Trump believes Russia can be America's ally in the fight against ISIS, he doesn't have to "trash" American intelligence professionals in the process. "There is something very unusual -- indeed, even sort of suspicious -- about the degree to which he casually kicks aside the intelligence community when he won't even go to the briefings again and again and takes the Assange/Vladimir Putin line on this important question" about whether Russian was behind the election-related hacks, Kaine said. California Rep. Adam Schiff, a member of the House Select Committee on Intelligence, said Republicans' confidence in Assange over the intelligence community is "embarrassing." "You hear former colleagues like mine, Vice President-elect Mike Pence, tie themselves in knots, or my colleague (California Republican) Darrell Issa, saying they put more faith in an accused sex offender than their own intelligence agencies," the Democrat told Chris Cuomo on "New Day." "It's embarrassing to be honest with you," he added. "This is not healthy skepticism as they would like to portray it. This is very unhealthy, essentially avoidance of the facts." Schiff also said he didn't expect Trump to change his tune after he receives an extensive intel briefing on the hacking on Friday. "He has been briefed, he knows better," Schiff said. "It's at odds with his own preferred version of events, and he will not accept it." He added, "I think it goes back to a very simple thing. It's not unrelated to Julian Assange. That is during the campaign, WikiLeaks was helpful to him, Assange was helpful to him. During the campaign, the Russian hacks were helpful to him, and Donald Trump does not bite the hand that feeds him." Trump's ongoing feud with the intelligence community just weeks before his inauguration suggests that there will be unusual tension between the White House and America's top spies on national security issues. When the President-elect enters office, he would have invested more credibility in the head of Russian and the fugitive who founded WikiLeaks than leading US intelligence agencies. "When he's quoting Julian Assange, who is wanted for Assange is wanted by Swedish authorities over allegations of sexual assault, and was granted asylum at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London in 2012.

Those comments are a sharp contrast to Trump's current position on WikiLeaks, which published leaked documents from prominemt Democratic officials during the election. During a rally in October of last year, Trump exclaimed "I love WikiLeaks." Just this week, Trump cited the group's founder, Julian Assange, who claimed in an interview that Russia was not involved in hacking during the U.S. election. CNN's KFile reported on Wednesday that Trump called WikiLeaks "disgraceful" and said "there should be like death penalty or something" in another December 2010 interview. During the interview with Fox Business Network's "Follow the Money," Trump, who was considering a run for president, brought up WikiLeaks on his own accord as an example of a decline of America's prestige. At the time, WikiLeaks was publishing classified material leaks to them by Pfc. Chelsea Manning, who was then known as Pfc. Bradley Manning. "You look at WikiLeaks, I mean, in China, if this would've happened the people would get a bullet through their head within 24 hours and here in this country we're embarrassed, everybody's embarrassed," Trump said. "We're calling the leaders of other countries horrible names -- how do you go back and negotiate with people with that. That's just not the way life works. As far as I'm concerned it's spying, it's espionage." "They should try that young -- they call him private first class -- I call him private last class. They should try that young private and they should frankly either put him in jail for the rest of his life or maybe get the death penalty," continued Trump. "You know, in the old days if you were a spy and that's what he is you'd get the death penalty." During a rally in October of this year Trump exclaimed "I love WikiLeaks." The organization was at the time leaking emails from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and had previously released emails from the Democratic National Committee. The president-elect has questioned the assessment from the U.S. intelligence community that the Russian government was behind the hacks, and cited Assange's denial of Russian involvement on Twitter.

"Intelligence is hard, thankless work. Fortunately, we have dedicated, patriotic, and courageous men and women on the job. Thanks," retired Gen. Martin Dempsey tweeted. Dempsey has been mum about Trump -- as well as anything else involving the US intelligence community and politics. In July, he made a rare political statement when he wrote an open letter to generals -- specifically retired Marine Gen. John Allen and retired Army Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn -- for being involved at political conventions. "The military is not a political prize," He continued, "It was a mistake for them to participate as they did. It was a mistake for our presidential candidates to ask them to do so." Since the intelligence community began revealing its growing belief that Russia meddled in the US presidential election -- with some agencies believing Russia did so to aid Trump -- the President-elect has attacked a key body he will rely on once he enters the Oval Office. Last month, Trump And on Tuesday, Trump mocked the US intelligence community by suggesting that intelligence officials postponed an "'intelligence' briefing on so-called 'Russian hacking'" because they might need more time "to build a case." He called the alleged delay -- which has been disputed by US intelligence officials -- as "very strange." ©Republicans on Capitol Hill are still feeling out President-elect Donald Trump -- but they're warmly embracing his vice president, Mike Pence. Pence held court in private meetings with GOP members of the House, and then the Senate, on Wednesday. Those visits are set to become more permanent: Like Dick Cheney, the soon-to-be vice president will have office space in both the Senate -- where he technically presides as president and will cast tie-breaking votes -- and the House, too. He also plans to attend weekly policy lunches, positioning Pence as President-elect's chief fixer on Capitol Hill. It's too early to tell what role Pence will play in setting policy -- or whether he will consistently speak for the Trump administration on policy matters in a world where Trump can change the agenda with one tweet. But Republicans were gushing about the man they see as Trump's good cop -- one who bridges conservative divides where Trump at times deepens them -- just 16 days from inauguration. "I think it makes a unique situation -- somebody who was elected in the class of 2000; somebody who understands the speed at which the House works. To have somebody like that as an advocate in the White House is going to prove to be very beneficial to us in the days ahead," said Rep. Mark Walker of North Carolina, who chairs the conservative Republican Study Committee -- the same role Pence once held when he was a member of Congress. "You could just feel it in the room," said Rep. Dave Brat, a Virginia Republican who was elected in 2014 after he ousted Pence's former House GOP leadership colleague Eric Cantor in a primary. "When someone that's respected comes in, you can just tell -- it's a walks-on-water type feeling there. So that spreads; other people can feel that." It's the role Pence was chosen to play: Trump, a newcomer to politics, needed someone to run the inside game for him -- so he tapped Pence, the Indiana governor who began his career as a talk radio host, over closer friends like Chris Christie and Newt Gingrich. Since departing his post in Republican leadership in 2010 and Congress altogether in 2012, Pence has maintained relationships with Republicans including Speaker Paul Ryan and House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling. Much of the House has turned over since then -- but newer members who are just now getting to know Pence say his relationships with current GOP leaderships and his status as a top figure in a party remade by Trump give Pence major influence. Rep. Larry Bucshon, an Indiana Republican who served one term alongside Pence in the House and worked with him during Pence's governorship, said Pence will be "a great liaison for the President-elect." "One of the things we have not had from the current administration is a good deal of interaction from the White House to Congress in general," Bucshon said. "If we're going to move the country forward, an important relationship is between Capitol Hill and Pennsylvania Avenue." "I also trust that he's going to be a voice for House members as well -- which is pretty exciting," said Rep. Glenn Thompson, R-Pennsylvania. Pence's role appears to mirror the previous Republican vice president: Cheney. Especially early in George W. Bush's presidency, Cheney functioned as the relative newcomer Bush's guide to Washington. Much like Pence will, Cheney attended policy lunches with lawmakers and held one-on-one meetings in his offices near the House and Senate. President Barack Obama was a legislator himself -- but Vice President Joe Biden's relationships with top Republicans, particularly Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, were much deeper. Obama didn't need Biden stationed on Capitol Hill regularly, but Biden still became instrumental to cutting deals over government funding and the debt ceiling. Trump even selected Marc Short -- a former aide from Pence's time in the House and Koch brothers political operative who joined the campaign out of loyalty to Pence -- as his legislative director. Pence, Short and other top Trump aides were on Capitol Hill Wednesday to meet privately with Republicans. Most of the day's focus was on strategizing for the GOP push to repeal the Affordable Care Act -- with Pence advising lawmakers to blame Democrats for any of the health reform's failings. At the same time President Barack Obama was huddled with House Democrats across the Capitol -- urging them not to "rescue" the GOP by giving them a few votes to help pass "something worse" -- Pence was instructing Republicans to argue they are only trying to clean up Democrats' mess. "The reality is that I was here in March of 2010 in another capacity when Obamacare was signed into law," Pence said along side other GOP leaders including House Speaker Paul Ryan after the meeting. "I remember all those promises. We were told that if you like your doctor, you can keep it. Not true." The comments came as the President-elect tweeted -- in a reference to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York -- that the GOP shouldn't "let the Schumer clowns out of this web." Rep. Chris Collins, a New York Republican and Trump ally, said Pence would play a "lead role" in devising a replacement for the law's coverage of 20 million Americans. Republicans said afterward that the meeting gave them confidence that -- even in the midst of a tweetstorm -- Pence does speak for Trump. "One hundred percent," Brat said. "I haven't seen a hair's difference between the two." "One hundred percent," Brat said. "I haven't seen a hair's difference between the two." ©President Barack Obama is asking his Cabinet to spell out what progress they've made over the past eight years while offering incoming Republican officials their view of a path forward. The "exit memos" released Thursday offer a view of Obama's accomplishments, but also a map of areas where President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to change course. In a letter addressed to Americans that accompanied the memos, Obama wrote that during his first inaugural address: "I told you that day that the challenges we faced would not be met easily or in a short span of time -- but they would be met." "After eight busy years, we've met them -- because of you," Obama wrote. He detailed a litany of achievements, from reviving the US economy to passing Obamacare to securing diplomatic agreements on climate change and Cuba -- achievements he hopes will come to form his presidential legacy. Those issues are at risk under Trump, however, and in his letter Obama insisted that the progress his administration has made wasn't solely attached to him. "We will have to move forward as we always have -- together," Obama wrote. "And I'm confident we will. Because the change we've brought about these past eight years was never about me. It was about you." Secretary of State John Kerry's memo, released early Thursday, offers a broad defense of the President's foreign policy, noting signature achievements such as the Iran nuclear deal, the resumption of diplomatic relations with Cuba, and the Paris climate agreement. The memo also touches on the state of US relations with allies and adversaries alike, including Russia, whose "unprecedented cyber intrusions and its military intervention in Syria," Kerry said, "have also posed significant challenges to both our bilateral relationship and to international stability, and it is critical that we remain vigilant against these and other threats, even as we look for areas where it is in our interest to cooperate with Russia." While never mentioning Trump by name, Kerry cautions against some of the isolationist impulses the President-elect has promoted, including a rejection of most trade deals, and a disinclination towards getting involved in foreign conflicts. "In this time of great uncertainty in the world, it is not surprising that some Americans want to turn inward and search for ways to separate our own safety and prosperity from that of the international community," Kerry wrote. "But it is folly to think we can build a more secure and prosperous future by hiding from the world or by severing our connections to it. International challenges must be confronted with honesty, determination and confidence -- not isolation."

Republicans are concerned that a full-scale bill will become unwieldy and will be difficult to attract support. So instead, top Republicans are looking at a mix of smaller bills that could attract bipartisan support in Congress and executive actions that could be pursued by President-elect Donald Trump and Rep. Tom Price if he's confirmed as Health and Humans Services secretary. "We're not going to do a comprehensive bill. We are going to do it in a step-by-step basis," Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican, told CNN. "If I've learned anything since I've been here in the Senate, big comprehensive bills are not the way to go." Asked which aspect of health care Republicans would tackle first on a replacement measure: "That hasn't been decided." Cornyn's statement comes as House Republicans are floating different timelines for a replacement bill. "Our legislating will occur this year. Our legislating on Obamacare, our repealing and replacing and transitioning -- you know, the legislating will occur this year," House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters Thursday, but other lawmakers have spoken about a six-month timeframe.

Obama's dense and scholarly piece in the Harvard Law Review, running almost 60 pages with extensive footnotes and citations, offers a summation of his work toward reforming the way Americans are sentenced and imprisoned. It also spells out prescriptions for future presidents, despite the tough-on-crime rhetoric that President-elect Donald Trump espoused on the campaign trail last year. Obama is expected in the coming days to take further action in reducing sentences for non-violent drug offenders, part of a broader unilateral effort to ease harsh punishments. In his tenure, Obama has reduced the sentences of more than 1,000 non-violent drug offenders, far surpassing other recent presidents, who used their commutation powers more sparingly. In his efforts, Obama has focused intently on reducing sentences for people convinced of crack-related crimes, which carry sentences that far exceed those for powdered cocaine. The disparity has overwhelmingly affected African-Americans. "We cannot deny the legacy of racism that continues to drive inequality in how the justice system is experienced by so many Americans," the President wrote in the article Thursday. Obama, who was elected as the first black editor of the Harvard Law Review in 1990, sought in his article to imbue his case with personal meaning, writing that his push toward eliminating mandatory minimum sentences and offering clemency to non-violent drug offenders was informed by his own history. "This is an effort that has touched me personally, and not just because I could have been caught up in the system myself had I not gotten some breaks as a kid," Obama wrote in the law review, recalling meetings at the White House with recipients of his clemency grants who had turned their life around. "By shifting the narrative to the way clemency can be used to correct injustices in the system -- and reminding people of the value of second chances -- I worked to reinvigorate the clemency power and to set a precedent that will make it easier for future presidents, governors and other public officials to use it for good," Obama wrote. White House officials on Wednesday expressed confidence that growing bipartisan momentum for reform efforts will convince Trump and his attorney general nominee, Sen. Jeff Sessions, to adopt at least some of Obama's practices going forward. A bill sponsored by the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Chuck Grassley, and the Democratic Whip, Dick Durbin, will be revived in the Congress that was sworn in this week. The measure, which would include altering mandatory minimum sentences and reform the prison system, has a wide array of backers. "There is still very strong bipartisan support, both among a range of advocacy groups from civil rights organizations, to law enforcement, to the faith community, to the business community, and that momentum remains steadfast," said Valerie Jarrett, Obama's senior adviser, on Wednesday. "I think the fact that there is so much momentum going on around the country and on both sides of the aisle, and in both chambers in Washington, gives us a reason to be optimistic," Jarrett said. However, among activists who have pushed the President to utilize his clemency powers to reduce prison sentences, there was little optimism that Trump would continue apace with Obama's efforts. Trump ran on a "law and order" platform, though rarely addressed issues of clemency or sentencing on the campaign trail. "I'm hopeful that he would consider continuing the clemency program or having an initiative of his own. There are some folks that I'd like to get to," said Cynthia Roseberry, project manager for Clemency Project 2014, which has helped federal inmates apply for commutations or pardons. Roseberry, like other advocates for some type of sentencing reform, said it hasn't been clear from Trump's public statements what direction he'll take on the issue. "I'm looking at various predictors to try and decide where he might go. He wants to make America safe again. We know based on data that locking up low-level offenders won't make America safe," said Jessica Jackson Sloan, the national director and co-founder of #cut50, a group committed to reducing the US prison population by half. "I'm hopeful that we'll be surprised," Sloan said. Obama's article in the law journal is the first work of high-level legal scholarship by a sitting president, according to the President of the Harvard Law Review Michael Zuckerman. "We put all of our pieces through a rigorous editing process, and this piece was no exception, just on a compressed time line, given the President's schedule," Zuckerman said Wednesday. "We edited the piece in a couple of very quick turnarounds huddled over our computer screens on the eve of final exams this past December."

Analysts have described the younger bin Laden, who was born in 1989, as a "crown prince" of al Qaeda, the terror group founded by his father and associates in the late 1980s. Hamza was said to have been close to his father, and was often by his side as he grew up. As a young boy he was seen in al Qaeda propaganda videos, surrounded by men wielding guns, making threats against the West. "From a very early age, his father was kind of grooming him," said CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen, author of the book "United States of Jihad." "Hamza has been very much indoctrinated with the whole jihadi kind of message. He's a true believer. I think that makes him a concern," Al Qaeda staged its most audacious attack on US soil on September 11, 2001, when its members carried out four co-ordinated attacks on major US targets, killing round 3,000 people. The attack prompted the US invasion of Afghanistan in the search for the al Qaeda leadership and its allies in the Taliban. Bin Laden was killed in a raid by US Navy SEALs on his hideout in Bergen said the SEALS thought Hamza might have been there when they dropped from helicopters onto the bin Laden compound on May 2 but he wasn't. In his late 20s, Hamza bin Laden is considered to be the potential new face of al Qaeda. "They're saying this is a new generation of jihadi leadership. This is the new bin Laden who's going to openly lead us in the future," said Thomas Joscelyn, a senior fellow at the Foundation of Defense of Democracies. Analysts said that the younger bin Laden could help rejuvenate Al Qaeda's foundering terror brand. It has lost a number of top leaders and been eclipsed by ISIS, especially in the market place for young jihadis. "ISIS' productions are a million times more interesting than Al Qaeda's very boring audio messages (and) very low production values," Bergen said. Hamza bin Laden was officially announced by al Qaeda senior leader That same year, in an audio message released by al-Zawahiri, the younger bin Laden called for "lone offender attacks against US, French, and Israeli interests in Washington, DC; Paris, France; and Tel Aviv, Israel." In July 2016, al Qaeda issued another audio message from Hamza bin Laden threatening revenge against the US for his father's death and warning Americans they would be targeted at home and abroad.xc2xa0 The State Department said Hamza "is actively engaged in terrorism" and "as a result of this designation, all property subject to US jurisdiction in which Hamza bin Laden has any interest is blocked and US persons are generally prohibited from engaging in any transactions with him."

"I have been called a heretic, an apostate, an adulterer, a charlatan, and an addict. It has been falsely reported that I once filed for bankruptcy and -- my personal favorite -- that I deny the Trinity!" "I have hesitated to even address such patently false accusations about my personal life and my beliefs so as to not dignify them with a response," White said in a statement. The 50-year-old pastor is one of "But since these comments pose a potential distraction to an otherwise celebratory and historic time in our country, I would like to set the record straight in the hope of returning our collective attention to what's most important." In a Thursday appearance on CNN's "OutFront," White called the wave of criticism "amazing" and said there was "absolute absurdity" to a lot of the accusations facing her. She reiterated the claims she made in her statement and blasted those who called her faith into question, particularly over her divorce. "God knew everything I would go through before I ever went through it," White told CNN's Erin Burnett. "Not everything is perfect in my life, but I don't think everything is perfect in anybody's life." White, a megachurch pastor and televangelist in Florida, has long been a controversial figure in Christian circles, where many find fault with her promotion of the "prosperity gospel," which teaches that God bestows health and wealth on true believers, particularly those who donate money to ministers. In 2007, the Senate investigated White and other televangelists who had made millions from their ministry. According to an audit made public by a Senate committee, White's former church, Without Walls International, took in $150 million between 2004-2006. At one time, White and her then-husband owned an airplane and several multimillion dollar properties, including a condo in Trump Tower. Like Trump, White has been married three times. After White's divorce from her second husband in 2007, the church they led together plunged into bankruptcy. Her current husband is Jonathan Cain, the keyboard player for Journey and a co-writer of the epic hit "Don't Stop Believin'." In her books and sermons, White has spoken of her troubled early years, including sexual abuse she suffered as a child and family members' addictions to drugs.* "My life and my decisions have been nowhere near perfect, though nothing like what has been falsely conveyed in recent days," White said. Much of the recent criticism of White has focused on her theology, not her personal life. Evangelicals in particularly Besides their issues with the prosperity gospel, conservative Christians have accused White of denying the Trinity, a core Christian doctrine since at least the 4th century. In a In her statement, though, White says, "I believe and have always believed in the Holy Trinity," as well the rest of the Nicene Creed, including the "exclusivity and divinity of Jesus Christ." The pastor also struck back at critics who accuse her of peddling a "feel-good gospel," saying that she has preached and written as often about the "difficult seasons" of life as she has about "times of abundance." For his part, Trump, who has "She has a significant message to offer anyone who will tune in and pay attention," Trump has said of the pastor. "She has amazing insight and the ability to deliver that message clearly as well as powerfully." ©A push by Republican congressional leaders to defund Planned Parenthood could threaten passage of their top-priority legislation to repeal Obamacare because of opposition to the anti-abortion provision by two key GOP senators. House Speaker Paul Ryan announced Thursday that Republicans will move to strip all federal funding for Planned Parenthood as part of the process they are using early this year to dismantle Obamacare. Congressional Republicans have tried for years to zero out all federal funding for Planned Parenthood because the group provides abortion services. The fight over Obamacare helped trigger a 16-day government shutdown in 2013, and Democrats and President Barack Obama insisted any Planned Parenthood provision targeting the group be removed from a bill to fund federal agencies. The decision to add the controversial Planned Parenthood language, which is opposed by most Democrats, could have a major impact on getting the Affordable Care Act repeal legislation through the Senate because supporters need the backing of at least 50 of their 52 members and two pro-choice senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, won't commit to approving the bill with the Planned Parenthood provision in it. Further complicating matters for Senate GOP leaders is Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, who announced this week he plans to vote against the Obamacare repeal legislation because the underlying budget measure it is attached to doesn't balance and adds to the deficit. If Murkowski, Collins and Paul all voted against the budget bill, it would be enough to torpedo the Obamacare repeal legislation. "I'm going to wait and see what happens," Collins told reporters, indicating she thinks it's too early to decide how she will vote on the bill. "Obviously, I'm not happy to hear the speaker wants to include defunding of Planned Parenthood, an extremely controversial issue in the package." Murkowski's told reporters Tuesday she was still weighing the issue. In 2015, she joined Collins in voting for an amendment to strip Planned Parenthood funding out of a budget bill that would have also repealed much of Obamacare. But Murkowski ultimately backed the repeal measure even though it had the anti-Planned Parenthood provision, which Obama ultimately vetoed. "At this point and time, I have not been involved in a sit down with colleagues about specifics of reconciliation. So it's tough for me to speculate or engage in any conjecture," Murkowski said earlier this week. "We're going to be having a lot of discussions about that probably as soon as this week." When asked her position Thursday, Murkowski's spokeswoman Karina Petersen said, the senator "is concerned about defunding Planned Parenthood as she is a longtime support of Planned Parenthood and has opposed broadly defunding the organization." Republicans could drop the Planned Parenthood measure, but doing so could spark anger from the right-flank of their party and potentially make it harder to defund the organization at a later date. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican in his chamber, said "that's certainly where I am" when asked if he wanted to include defunding of the organization into the repeal measure. But he noted "that's place we start" and that nothing has "finally been decided yet." "While we would like to have all 52 senators, if we have a vice president in the chair, that gives us a little bit of flexibility on reconciliation," Cornyn said Thursday, referencing the ability of the vice president to break Senate ties. The vast majority of federal money that Planned Parenthood does receive funds preventive health care, birth control, pregnancy tests, and other women's health care services. Democrats also point out that much of the money the group received is through the Medicaid program, which reimburses health care clinics that provide care to those covered by the federal program. Under the long-standing "Hyde amendment" that is attached to annual funding bills, no federal money is allowed to go to programs that include abortion services, unless they are needed to preserve the life of the mother or are caused by rape. Democrats immediately denounced the news that Republicans again were working to bar future federal funds for Planned Parenthood. "This is a priority for the Republicans," said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi Thursday afternoon. "So I just would like to speak individually to women across America: this is about respect for you, for your judgment about your personal decisions in terms of your reproductive needs, the size and timing of your family or the rest, not to be determined by the insurance company or by the Republican ideological right-wing caucus in the House of Representatives. So this is a very important occasion where we're pointing out very specifically what repeal of the (Affordable Care Act) will mean to woman." Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, told CNN's Erin Burnett on "OutFront" Thursday that "concerned" women have lobbied against the move throughout the day. "His phone has been jammed up today," Richards said. Anti-abortion rights groups point to a letter that the Trump campaign signed in September pledging support for "Defunding Planned Parenthood as long as they continue to perform abortions, and re-allocating their funding to community health centers that provide comprehensive health care for women." "Vulnerable pro-abortion Democratic senators need to do a serious gut check, especially following the 2016 election outcome, and decide if they will stand with their constituents and women's health care or continue to funnel money to big abortion," warned Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group, in a written statement.

"I don't think that there's any silver bullet to the party's issues, but I do think there's an opportunity, especially with a perspective that comes from state or local government, and from a part of the country where Democrats absolutely should be winning races, and haven't been," he said in an interview with CNN. Buttigieg joins a contest that has largely divided along the same lines as the party's 2016 primary -- with backers of President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton supporting Labor Secretary Tom Perez, and supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders rallying behind Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison. Buttigieg, who is 34 and openly gay, is a Harvard graduate and Rhodes Scholar. He served as a Naval officer in Afghanistan. His only bid for statewide office has been a failed 2010 campaign for Indiana state treasurer. However, he has won easily in South Bend, a manufacturing-heavy Rust Belt town that is home to Notre Dame University. Buttigieg said he wants to move the party past a backward-looking proxy battle. "I think we need to get past that as a party. Reliving 2016 is not really good for business for the Democratic Party," he said. "Obviously, we can learn from the past, but this needs to be about the future. We have much more important things to fight than each other." He could help Democrats in a soul-searching phase as the party grapples with its loss of white working-class voters, which cost Clinton Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, pushing Donald Trump toward the presidency. "This is exceptionally important: Speaking to one group of potential Democratic voters cannot mean abandoning another," Buttigieg said. He pointed to his own experience in South Bend, a city that has a sizable minority population, even though a majority of its residents are white. "We didn't pick one demographic over another. The point is, look, the core of our moral authority as a party is our defense of equality, fairness, things like voting rights," he said. "But we also are, I believe, motivated by values that are universal. I believe when we talk about fairness, we can do that in a way that appeals to all types of voters and all kinds of Americans. And I think not being afraid to talk about our values will resonate in places where we as a party have been struggling." In addition to Buttigieg, Perez and Ellison, South Carolina Democratic chairman Jaime Harrison and New Hampshire state chairman Ray Buckley are also in the DNC chair's race. Ellison and Perez each issued statements welcoming Buttigieg into the race. "Democrats deserve a vibrant conversation about the direction of our party," Perez said. "Pete showed tremendous courage during his re-election campaign when he came out -- no easy thing to do in a red state like Indiana in the middle of an election," Ellison said. The party is set to meet for its first regional forum in Phoenix next week.

According to Sen. Rand Paul, it's not working. Paul, the Kentucky Republican, is leading a lonely charge against GOP leaders' plan to approve a budget resolution that clears the way for Obamacare's repeal -- in part by lifting spending limits in a way he says would balloon the deficit by $9.7 trillion over 10 years. He met with 25 House Republicans on Thursday -- mostly members of the conservative Freedom Caucus -- to urge them to stymie the measure in the House after he was the lone Republican to oppose it in the Senate. Paul complained on a call with reporters Thursday evening that Republicans are doing exactly what they accused President Barack Obama and Democrats of doing for years: Spending recklessly to accomplish political objectives. "I think it's important, no matter who's in charge ... to be vigilant for conservative principles," Paul said. "Before I got in politics, I was a private citizen and I watched the George W. Bush administration -- with Republicans complicit and Democrats complicit -- grow the debt from $5 to $10 trillion. The Obama administration grew it from $10 to $20 trillion." House and Senate leaders have said the budget resolution is merely a stopgap designed to allow them to strike down Obamacare without Democratic votes in the Senate, and say it won't take effect and actually increase spending. But Paul said he fears Republicans will use the same claims later this year to enact Trump priorities including tax reform. If Paul is ultimately successful, it would thwart the avenue Republican leaders had identified to work around Democratic objections and roll back Obama's signature domestic achievement. It's not the only area where deficit spending concerns are causing at least some Republicans to hit the brakes on Trump's priorities. A massive infrastructure initiative was a big talking point for the President-elect, but "We're going to start to work on it, but first of all, you've got to figure out the pay for it, which will come, I believe, in the first 100 days. Then in the next second 100 days is when we'll put together a big infrastructure package," he said. While Paul cast the lone vote against the budget measure Wednesday, other Senate Republicans raised concerns. Sens. Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and Mike Lee sent a letter to the party's Senate leaders urging "transparent spending and revenue numbers" to be included in the budget resolution for 2018 -- even as they agreed with the 2017 budget resolution that includes the language that will help the GOP repeal Obamacare. "Our votes in favor of the 'Obamacare Repeal Resolution' do not indicate in any way our support for the revenue, spending and deficit numbers therein, nor for the use of those numbers as the basis for future federal budgets," the three wrote. Paul, meanwhile, didn't leave his meeting with the House Republicans with any firm commitments, as Freedom Caucus members said they'd discuss the topic at a caucus meeting Monday. "The Freedom Caucus has been very strong in its support of a balanced budget, and it's too early to tell whether that would be a casualty of voting for this budget," said Rep. Mark Meadows, the chairman of the House Freedom Caucus. "Any time you look at anything, you've got to be concerned about the cost," Meadows said. Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said "we're waiting for our meeting" to discuss the group's position. "We heard some good information from Rand. We had some good dialogue back and forth," he said. Others deflected questions about the mechanics of how Congress will roll back Obama's health law. "I'm supportive of repealing Obamacare," said Rep. Justin Amash, R-Michigan. Paul acknowledged in an interview with CNN Wednesday that the Senate GOP budget move is related to Obamacare but says it doesn't have to raise the deficit. "We're told they're doing this just so they can get rid of Obamacare, and that's true. Well we could have done both. We could have introduced a budget that actually leads to balance, is fiscally conservative and repeals Obamacare," Paul said.

After that, everything is an open question -- and a potential political nightmare. Not only does the GOP lack a replacement plan, there is no consensus on how long it will take Republicans to come up with and pass a comprehensive health care bill -- or a series of smaller measures -- or how many people would have health insurance under it. House Speaker Paul Ryan said Thursday that Congress will act this year, but didn't issue a firm deadline or say what the law will look like. "Our legislating will occur this year. Our legislating on Obamacare, our repealing and replacing and transitioning -- you know, the legislating will occur this year," Ryan told reporters. Ryan also won't specify who would be covered under a new GOP system. Pressed whether the same amount of people covered currently would be covered under a new system, the speaker punted, saying he didn't want to get ahead of committee action. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn of Texas said Thursday Republicans wouldn't even offer a comprehensive bill to replace Obamacare, opting for individual health care measures instead that could draw bipartisan support. The worry: a full-scale bill will become unwieldy and will be difficult to attract support. "We're not going to do a comprehensive bill. We are going to do it in a step-by-step basis," Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican, told CNN. "If I've learned anything since I've been here in the Senate, big comprehensive bills are not the way to go." Adding factors such as defunding Planned Parenthood, which Ryan pledged to do Thursday, could also make things more difficult for the GOP. No matter what, the clock is ticking for Republicans. Following a House GOP conference meeting Wednesday featuring Vice President-elect Mike Pence, Rep. Chris Collins said the party was looking at a half-year window in which to come up with a replacement. "I think six months is a date we have talked about within our conference," said Collins, who serves on President-elect Donald Trump's transition team. "Within six months, we should be able to put pen to paper and have a replacement plan. Certainly we're not doing that on day one." But a Ryan aide said there's no such deadline and that one wasn't discussed in the gathering with Pence. "Our goal is to provide relief from this terrible law as soon as possible and we have not detailed a hard deadline," a Ryan aide told CNN Thursday morning. "Our goal is as soon as possible." Not everyone in the House GOP conference is on board with Ryan's "soon as possible" approach. Colorado GOP Rep. Mike Coffman said Wednesday that a six-month timeline for presenting a replacement plan is "awfully short." "If it is too short there's a concern that the insurance market can't price for that," Coffman said. The internal frictions that has started to emerge within the GOP is emblematic of the party's broader political dilemma on Obamacare. For Obamacare's inception in 2010, Republicans have railed against the President's signature health care reform law and vowed to roll it back. Now, just days away from controlling the House, the Senate and the White House, Republicans are But this political move comes with numerous policy and real world consequences -- health care experts, insurance companies and Americans who have coverage through Obamacare have begun to ring the alarm bell. This reality that has made it difficult for the GOP to quickly present details and deadlines on Obamacare replacement. To calm fears of potential chaos, GOP leaders are promising a "transition" period as part of a "repeal and delay" plan. But there is also no consensus on how long Republicans want to delay the repeal from going into effect. Ryan said questions about when a replacement program would begin working -- assuming one is passed -- are open for discussion. "What date all of this gets phased in on is something we do not now know, because we're waiting for the Trump administration to be stood up," Ryan said. "We're waiting for Tom Price to be confirmed and become the secretary of Health and Human Services. The question there is, how long will it take for markets to put in place, for markets to adjust. That question we don't know the answer to, but the legislating on Obamacare will happen this year." Democrats are pressuring Republicans on their plan to move forward with repealing Obamacare without having a replacement in sight. In a speech on the Senate floor Thursday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer again accused Republicans for playing a "game" with health care without having a plan on how to move forward. "It's no longer just a game or a political line to say 'repeal.' Because now, you have to replace," Schumer said. "So far, it's been five years of repeal, repeal, repeal. Not one replace plan has garnered a lot of support even on the Republican side of the aisle let alone in America." Ryan called such statements "scare tactics." "I think they're trying to make Americans think like someday this February or someday this March you're going to wake up and you won't have a health insurance plan. That ain't happening. That's not true," Ryan said. "What we're doing is we're going to be methodical, we're going to be deliberative, and we're going to do this the right way. We're going to get this law repealed. We're going to get this law replaced. And we're going to have a transition period so that people do not have the rug pulled out from underneath them while we get to a better place." "I think they're trying to make Americans think like someday this February or someday this March you're going to wake up and you won't have a health insurance plan. That ain't happening. That's not true," Ryan said. "What we're doing is we're going to be methodical, we're going to be deliberative, and we're going to do this the right way. We're going to get this law repealed. We're going to get this law replaced. And we're going to have a transition period so that people do not have the rug pulled out from underneath them while we get to a better place." ©In meetings with senators ahead of his confirmation next week, secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson articulated a realist, conservative view of the world this week that one source described as "diametrically opposed" to many of the ideas touted by his future boss, President-elect Donald Trump. But lawmakers still said they have concerns about the incoming administration's Russia policy. Senators and senate aides from both parties said that Tillerson made a good first impression in his meetings this week, but they were still looking for a clear statement on Russia during his testimony next week. "He is at heart a conservative businessman, with a worldview that has been shaped by mainstream Republican principles," one aide told CNN. "Every nominee has to contend with how their views fit in with the administration they are entering, but with Tillerson, I think an important question next week will be at what point do his moral convictions and what he knows to be true contrast with the president he is about to serve?" Several sources said that Tillerson projected a clear-eyed view toward Russia, including the need to get tough with President Vladimir Putin. "He indicated that he knew what Putin was about and that you need to deal with Russia from a position of strength. He framed his relationship with Putin as one where he felt he could talk to him frankly and that he was prepared to do that," another staffer told CNN. "He gave good answers and I can say the tone was encouraging." Sen. John McCain, who described his meeting Wednesday with Tillerson as "good" and productive," said he had additional questions and concerns about Russia he hoped Tillerson would address. "He satisfied some of my concerns," McCain told reporters Wednesday, but added, "I have additional concerns." Sources said Tillerson would not be drawn into the ongoing dispute between the President-elect and the intelligence community over Russian interference in the US presidential election and avoided discussing specific policies the incoming Trump administration may pursue. While he voiced skepticism as CEO of ExxonMobil about the effectiveness of sanctions, Tillerson acknowledged in his meetings with senators that sanctions could be a useful policy tool, although he declined to endorse any particular sanctions. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker said Tillerson's views on international relations -- including Russia -- are very much in the "mainstream of foreign policy thinking here in the US." Corker, who will oversee Tillerson's confirmation hearings, met with the former ExxonMobil chief executive Tuesday. Asked if he expects Tillerson, who has a relationship with Putin and has cut business deals in that country, will lead a robust policy towards Russia, Corker said yes. That's been a key concern of several GOP senators, including McCain. "I had a long private conversion with him. I had talked to him on the phone prior to that," said Corker, who was also reportedly under consideration by Trump for the secretary of state position. "I think what people are going to find when they hear Tillerson in the hearing is that he's very, very much in the mainstream of US foreign policy thinking." Senate Democrats were also heartened by Tillerson's comments about climate change and his support of climate science. "He stressed, for me, his background in science and that he is a believer in science," said Sen. Ben Cardin, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee after his meeting on Wednesday. "That also was encouraging. So we did have a rather, I think a lengthy discussion about climate change issues and the importance of conservation and what we need to do in countries around the world where extreme poverty has denied many people access to a reasonable energy accessibility." Sen. Chris Coons, another Democrat on the committee, said he was "generally encouraged" by some of Tillerson's answers during their meeting, as well as his openness and humility, but had not decided whether to support his nomination. Tillerson is expected to give two days of testimony next week. Before then, senators and their aides are combing over documents he has provided to the committee. Although he didn't provide his tax returns, he did provide an extensive financial disclosure and ethics agreement. Senate aides say they are closely reviewing a plan ExxonMobil released this week to pay out Tillerson's holdings in the company -- which will net him about $180 million to be put into a blind trust. He also provided various speeches he had given as CEO of ExxonMobil and information on legal cases the company faced under his leadership. Despite Tillerson's impressive performance, senators and aides said concerns linger about the incoming administration's Russia policy, which was expected to be a focus of his confirmation hearing next week. "Russia is not a friend of the United States. We have serious concerns about Russia. I think that's a strong bipartisan message that you're going to hear during the confirmation process," Cardin said. "Obviously, he did business with Russia. He was able to get things done there and those relationships will be subject to questioning during the confirmation hearings." Another senator wary of Russia conceded that "Tillerson wasn't the problem," but warned that Trump's refusal to acknowledge Russia's interference in the election could slow his confirmation. "If Trump has an intelligence briefing on Russia on Friday and still denies the intel pointing to Russia is reliable, we are going to have a problem," the senator told CNN. "Trump's nominees will have to pick sides -- between the intel and Trump." "If Trump has an intelligence briefing on Russia on Friday and still denies the intel pointing to Russia is reliable, we are going to have a problem," the senator told CNN. "Trump's nominees will have to pick sides -- between the intel and Trump." ©The leading US intelligence official said Thursday that his foreign counterparts have expressed concern that President-elect Donald Trump is disparaging the US intelligence community, potentially damaging public confidence. "I do think public trust and confidence in the Intelligence Community is crucial" both in the US and in other countries that rely on US intelligence, James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, told the Senate Armed Services Committee. "I've received many expressions of concern from foreign counterparts about the disparagement of the US Intelligence Community, or I should say, what has been interpreted as disparagement of the US Intelligence Community." Clapper was speaking at a hearing on global cyberthreats that focused almost exclusively on Moscow's alleged hacking during the presidential elections. The hearing gave lawmakers and senior US intelligence officials the chance to draw a line in the sand for Trump, presenting a united front on their conclusion that Russia is a major threat to the United States and was behind election-related hacking -- a conclusion the President-elect has refused to accept. "We assess that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized the recent election-focused data thefts and disclosures, based on the scope and sensitivity of the targets," Clapper, Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence Marcel Lettre and the commander of US Cyber Command, Michael Rogers, wrote in a joint statement to the Senate Armed Services Committee. Clapper said at the hearing that there was a line between critical thinking about assessment and undermining those gathering the intelligence. "I think there is an important distinction here between healthy skepticism which policymakers -- to include policymaker No. 1 -- should always have on intelligence, but I think there's a difference between skepticism and disparagement," he said. And he noted that some intelligence agents die in service for their country. "You only need to walk into the lobby and look at the stars on the wall or the NSA and the number of intelligence people who have paid the ultimate price for their country," he said. Rogers told the committee that he was concerned about morale within the Intelligence Community and that having political leaders who are confident in intelligence agencies is "crucial to that." "I don't want to lose good, motivated people because they feel there's not room for them to contribute," Rogers said. "Without that confidence, I just don't want a situation where our workforce decides to walk because that's just not a good place for us to be." Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said he wanted to convey to Trump that "It's okay to challenge the intel, you're right to do so, but what I don't want you to do is undermine those who are serving our nation in this arena until you're absolutely sure they need to be undermined. "And I think they need to be uplifted," Graham added, "not undermined." In his opening questions to Clapper, Committee Chairman John McCain noted the Intelligence Community's conclusion that the cyberthefts and disclosures were intended to interfere with the US election process and could only have been authorized by Russia's most senior levels. "We stand actually more resolutely on the strength of that statement that we made on the seventh of October," Clapper said. After the election, the Intelligence Community concluded that at least one Russian motive had been to help Trump win. Clapper said that the hacking did not succeed in changing any vote tallies, but that it was impossible for intelligence to assess how the information released from the breaches affected voters' attitudes. McCain emphasized the Russian role and delivered an implicit rebuke to Trump, who has urged people to "move on" from the issue of Moscow-directed hacking. "Every American should be alarmed by Russia's attacks on our nation," the Arizona Republican said. "There's no escaping the fact that this committee meets today ... in the aftermath of an unprecedented attack on our democracy." McCain added that the "goal of this review is not to question the outcome of the election nor should it be." It's crucial that the country move forward with full knowledge about what happened and that Congress take bipartrisan steps, he said. Russia reacted almost immediately, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitr Peskov telling CNN that Moscow is "sick and tired of those irresponsibly blaming everything on our country. If there is a need for an enemy, why not to try someone else?" "We have suggested cooperation on combating cyberthreats numerous times," Peskov said. "It was rejected." But both Clapper and Rogers said in their testimony that the US has been trying to create international norms for cyber-related conflict. "We continue to engage with partners around the world about what is acceptable and unacceptable behavior in cyberspace, " Rogers said. "We are clearly not where we want to be in this regard." Trump has suggested that the Intelligence Community's conclusion on Russia was driven by political interests. Clapper, who enlisted in the Marine Corps in 1961, stressed that he has served every president "in the trenches" since John F. Kennedy. "I am apolitical," he said, adding that it was a priority to supply "unvarnished" and "untainted" policy recommendations to policy makers. On Wednesday, Trump championed WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange's claim that Russia wasn't the source of stolen documents from the Democratic National Committee that his group distributed. McCain asked Clapper whether Assange had endangered men and women serving the US with his earlier release of State Department cables. "Yes, he has," Clapper said. McCain then asked whether Assange should be accorded any credibility -- another implicit rebuke of Trump. Clapper responded, "No, he should not." The President-elect's apparent support for Assange and his dismissal of the intelligence community's findings on Russia have alarmed fellow Republicans, but on Thursday morning, Trump tweeted that "the media lies to make it look like I am against 'Intelligence' when in fact I am a big fan!" The intelligence leaders stressed before the Senate that instead of "moving on," Russia requires vigilance. "Russia is a full-scope cyber actor that poses a major threat to US government, military, diplomatic, commercial, and critical infrastructure and key resource networks because of its highly advanced offensive cyber program and sophisticated tactics, techniques, and procedures," they said. After Thursday's public hearing, Clapper, Lettre and Rogers may brief lawmakers in a closed session to discuss classified material, Senate aides said. Clapper is due to brief Trump Friday on Russia's actions in a private meeting. President Barack Obama ordered a full review of Russian meddling into the election a month ago and received the report Thursday morning. Clapper, who will brief Trump on the findings on Friday, said the report will speak to Russia's motivations. He also told lawmakers that an unclassified version will be released to the public. Speaking to WMAQ in Chicago Thursday, Obama said it was "important" Trump and Intelligence Community work together. "My hope is that when the President-elect receives his own briefings and is able to examine the intelligence as his team has put together and they see how professional and effective these agencies are, that some of those current tensions will be reduced," Obama said. "I can speak to my own experience -- it's going to be important to make sure the President and the intelligence communities are both working on the best possible information," Obama continued. Trump's stance sets up a likely clash with Congress, where the push to probe Russia's actions has been intensifying. Republicans like Graham and McCain want broad investigations into Russian behavior in cyberspace and overseas. After the hearing, McCain told reporters that Russia's ability to interfere in the elections was "a threat to national security." He added that "In the broadest context, it was an act of war," but said that retaliation would have to be carefully considered. "It fits the definition of an act of war, but it doesn't mean you start shooting over it," McCain said. McCain said he didn't know why Trump refuses to accept intelligence conclusions on Russia. Asked if he had any concerns about that, McCain said he wanted to wait until Trump was briefed on Friday. Graham told CNN in December that he and McCain plan to put sanctions together that hit Russian President Vladimir Putin "as an individual and his inner circle for interfering in our election" and in other nations' elections. Graham said that there are "a hundred United States senators ... I would say that 99 of us believe the Russians did this and we're going to do something about it." Meanwhile, a broad array of Democrats are calling for a public airing of Russia's efforts to sway the election. Senior Senate Democrats introduced a bill Wednesday to investigate the election interference. Trump's incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer tried to explain the President-elect's skepticism about the intelligence on Russia in a call with reporters Wednesday, distinguishing between raw data and conclusions drawn from that data. Trump "is more skeptical of conclusions from raw data, rather than intelligence and raw data provided," Spicer said. "That's why he's looking forward to meeting on Friday." Intelligence officials describe increasing dismay within their community about Trump's attacks and refusal to believe them. "It's a sad day when politicians place more stock in Vladimir Putin and Julian Assange than in the Americans who risk their lives daily to provide objective non-partisan intelligence analysis," one official told CNN. In Thursday's hearing, Connecticut Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal said Trump's "demeaning and dismissive" comments about intelligence officers were unacceptable and praised their service. "I want to thank you on behalf of all the women and men in the intelligence community," Clapper said. "I want to thank you for that." ©President-elect Donald Trump is prepared to take on Republican congressional leaders if they oppose his tough stance on trade, says incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer. "He's not looking for permission. He's going to do what he thinks the American people need to spur economic growth, to create jobs, to put the American worker first," Spicer told David Axelrod on "The Axe Files," a podcast from the University of Chicago Institute of Politics and CNN. "This isn't a guy who has spent the last year and a half asking people for permission to do things," added Spicer. "I think he wants input. He values ideas, opinions, analysis and facts -- and then he makes a decision and he goes with it." Asked whether Trump would govern with some humility, given that the country is sharply divided and he lost the popular vote by nearly three million votes, Spicer said the President-elect will presume a mandate for the policies on which he ran. "I think you gotta go forward with the things you campaigned on," Spicer said. On Trump's ongoing war of words with the intelligence community over Russia's role in election-year hacking of the Democratic National Committee, Spicer said it was inappropriate to draw any conclusions until the chiefs of key intelligence services present their final report on Friday. The conclusion of the intelligence community has been that Russia was behind the hacking, which led to the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats and additional punitive measures against the Russian government. But Trump's spokesman refused to say whether the President-elect, who has been openly skeptical of the conclusion that the Russians were behind the hacking, would be prepared to accept their verdict if the intelligence chiefs make a persuasive case. "I'm not going to prejudge the actions that he's going to take," Spicer said. "He's going to listen to them and then he will decide whether or not to make his opinion known." Spicer also defended Trump's tweet Wednesday in which the President-elect cited the denial by Julian Assange, the fugitive founder of WikiLeaks, that Russia was the source of Democratic Party emails his organization dumped during the campaign. "(Trump) threw out the idea that this is a guy who's out there saying he didn't do it," Spicer said. "And we need to ask the intelligence community, 'If he's denying this, is it that he's not telling the truth? Is it that he has a reputation for not telling the truth? Or is there actual evidence in facts and intelligence that connect him to it?'

Democrats are maneuvering to claim the interests of the American people on their side, with a rallying cry of transparency. They're decrying a combination of quick hearings -- several key nominees will testify next week -- with what they say is a slow pace of nominees returning standard paperwork for vetting. They want to put Trump on trial through his nominees, using the billionaires he's nominated to his Cabinet to call attention to conflicts of interest, and using conservative nominees to show how Trump has reversed course from previous campaign promises, according to aides and senators. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats want at least two days to review each nominee, full paperwork, tax returns for many of the nominees with complex financial records, and hearings spread out so members can attend as many as they want. "There are a lot of questions about these nominees," Schumer said. "And I would like to succeed in negotiating something but we get full and fair hearings. ... There are so many issues about so many of them that to rush them through would be a disservice to the American people." With a majority in the Senate, Republicans have a strong chance of confirming virtually all of Trump's nominees and are able to set the schedule and pace for the confirmation process. Several key nominees are set to testify next week, including Jeff Sessions as attorney general, Rex Tillerson as secretary of state and James Mattis as secretary of defense. One senior Democratic leadership aide maintained that stacking up the hearings and nominees is "exactly the kind of thing that can cause trouble" for the GOP with Democrats. Democrats are already getting backup from the progressive base. On Wednesday a progressive group launched an advertising blitz on television stations targeting vulnerable Republican senators to vote against Trump's nominee to run the Treasury Department, Steven Mnuchin. And more than 1,000 law school professors from across the country wrote a letter to the Judiciary Committee opposing Sessions, raising money to place the letter as a newspaper ad in senators' hometown newspapers. As of Wednesday evening, the effort had raised more than $15,000. Republicans say that they are following precedent in moving quickly on the President-elect's nominees. Several of President Barack Obama's nominees were confirmed in a voice vote on Inauguration Day and most of the rest of them soon followed, noted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's spokesman Don Stewart. "When President Obama was elected, Republicans and Democrats worked together and expeditiously to carefully consider his nominees," Stewart said. "Sen. Schumer and others approved wholeheartedly of this approach at the time, so surely they won't object to treating the incoming president's nominees with the same courtesy and seriousness with which the Senate acted on President Obama's nominees." McConnell told reporters on Wednesday that he hoped national security positions could move quickly. But Democrats say speed wasn't a problem for the Obama nominees because his team provided adequate background on nominees, while Trump's camp has not. "We are only expecting from the Trump nominees what the Obama nominees provided," said Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, who is the top Democrat on the committee that will confirm Trump's homeland security and budget picks. "All the Obama confirmations that occurred in the early weeks of the Obama administration, all of those things had been done. Only one nominee right now has that done, only one." Democratic lawmakers repeatedly cited conflict of interest forms from the Office of Government Ethics, financial disclosures and background checks from the FBI that are mandatory for nominees. "As Ronald Reagan said, 'Facts are stubborn things,' and ultimately I think if there is enough outcry and uproar about qualifications, that will have an effect," Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal said. Democrats don't have much say in when hearings are scheduled, but they can respond to a rushed hearing process by dragging out votes. Using procedural measures, Democrats could force each confirmation vote on the floor of the Senate to take up to a week, by insisting on cloture votes and full debate time for each nominee. That would string the confirmation process out over months and prevent any other legislation from getting done in the meantime. Republicans have in turn suggested they could make life just as painful for Democrats if they choose to stall, including holding votes in the middle of the night or early morning hours if that's when procedural time runs out, Democrats aren't backing off their demands, saying if the stall tactics come into play, Republicans will "own it," per No. 3 Senate Democrat Patty Murray. "If the Republicans can't come to a reasonable agreement and throw their first month or two into total chaos, it's on their back. We're willing to be reasonable," Schumer told CNN Wednesday. "We have a good deal of leverage. We hope we don't have to use it, but we have a good deal of leverage." At least one Democrat up for re-election in 2018 in a state carried by Trump this November, McCaskill, said she wasn't concerned about being labeled an obstructionist in opposing nominees. "That didn't seem to be a problem for (Sens.) Pat Toomey or Rob Portman -- and my recollection is they engaged in a whole lot of obstructionism," McCaskill said of two Republicans re-elected in battleground states this November. "I'm not going to be an obstructionist, but I'm going to do my job." "That didn't seem to be a problem for (Sens.) Pat Toomey or Rob Portman -- and my recollection is they engaged in a whole lot of obstructionism," McCaskill said of two Republicans re-elected in battleground states this November. "I'm not going to be an obstructionist, but I'm going to do my job." ©Some time in May 2014, Paul Overby, an American writer in his 70's, disappeared as he was traveling between Khost in Afghanistan and North Waziristan in Pakistan -- a region rife with the Taliban and terror groups such as al Qaeda. He has not been heard from since. On Wednesday, his wife went public for the first time with his disappearance, providing a statement to CNN and other media outlets. Overby's wife, who asked not to be identified by name, last heard from her husband on May 16, 2014, as he was preparing to cross the border into Pakistan. Until then, they had spoken every day on the phone. Overby, who frequently traveled to Afghanistan and Pakistan and was writing a book about the current war in Afghanistan, was on his way to interview Siraj Haqqani, the leader of the Haqqani network, which is a component of the Taliban and is responsible for many of most lethal bombing attacks in the Afghan capital, Kabul. In 2015, Haqqani was appointed deputy leader of the Taliban. The US State Department is offering a $10 million reward for information about him. Prior to his disappearance, Overby had spent one month in Kabul and a month in Khost, an Afghan province close to the Pakistani border where the Haqqani network has a strong presence. For the past two and half years, Overby's family had kept his disappearance a secret and had requested media outlets that were aware that he was missing, including CNN, also keep the matter confidential out of fear for his life if it became public. Overby' s disappearance was Yusufzai, who has reported authoritatively on the Taliban for more than two decades, wrote that his sources "in the Afghan Taliban group and their faction, Haqqani network" maintain that they don't hold Overby. In 1993, Overby published "Holy Blood: An Inside Account of the Afghan War," a Overby also learned to speak Pashto, the major language of the Afghan-Pakistan border area. When he disappeared, Overby, who is from western Massachusetts, was on his eighth trip to the region. His family provided emails to CNN that Overby had written in the days before he vanished. They contain discussions about why the US should not retain military bases in Afghanistan -- and fears for his safety. "We (the US) should not attempt to keep troops in Afghanistan, nor retain any bases ... bases only confirm the deep suspicion of many Afghans that America is planning to use this country as a base from which to contest the mastery of Central Asia, or at least play games, with Iran, Russia, and China," he wrote in one of the emails. Overby also worried about the potential risk: "As the time slowly spools out I'm not sure how I feel. Safe or in danger?" The working assumption of the US government and Overby's family is that he is being held captive by the Haqqanis. At a Pentagon briefing last month, Gen. John "Mick" Nicholson, the overall commander of US forces in Afghanistan, said that the Haqqanis are holding five Americans, although he did not provide the names. US officials said those Americans are: Caitlan Coleman, 31 (Coleman's two toddler sons, who both are under the age of four, were born in captivity); Kevin King, a teacher at the American University of Afghanistan in Kabul who was abducted in August near the university; and Overby. The Haqqanis also are holding hostage Coleman's Canadian husband, Joshua Boyle, 33, and another American University of Afghanistan teacher, Timothy Weeks, an Australian citizen. Caitlan Coleman addressed President-elect Donald Trump directly in a video released last month, urging him to secure the release of her and her family. She said the Haqqanis "are not going to simply release our family easily because it is correct. They want money, power and friends. ... We are told there are Afghans who are prisoners in Kabul that these men care about." Coleman was referring to Anas Haqqani, the brother of Siraj Haqqani, who is in on death row in Afghanistan after a court convicted him in August of raising money to fund terrorism. The Haqqanis have threatened to kill their American hostages if the Afghan government carries out the death sentence on Anas Haqqani. The incoming Trump administration has a great deal of leverage with the Afghan government, which is strongly hoping for a continued robust US presence in the country that will extend past the end of the Obama administration. Trump prides himself on the art of the deal, so he could use the leverage he has to secure the release of the American and other Western hostages that are held by the Haqqanis in exchange for the release of Anas Haqqani. At the same time, Trump could also pressure the Pakistani government, which has long had ties to the Haqqani Network, to secure the release of the American, Canadian and Australian hostages that the terrorist group is holding.

"What most impressed me was how far he hits the ball at 70 years old," Woods wrote The two played golf last month at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach in Florida. Trump posted a photo on his Facebook page December 24 that included his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and one of his granddaughters, Kai Trump, posing with Woods on a golf course. Woods said their "discussion topics were wide-ranging" and had "fun" playing with him. "We both enjoyed the bantering, bickering and needling," he wrote. "I also shared my vision for golf and what I'm trying to do." Woods said he appreciated the opportunity to play with the President-elect.

Over lunch, in West Wing meetings and in phone calls and emails, aides to President Barack Obama and his successor, Donald Trump, are hashing out the complicated logistics of transferring the federal government between the two who seem at odds on about nearly every political issue. Aides on both sides characterize the affable spirit as a necessity to an effective transition. Without ample and direct communication between teams, essential information about operating the vast federal machinery could be lost. Sharing advice on more personal topics, like how to balance family and the grind of a high-level administration post, has also helped foster ties between the current and future White Houses. Despite the drawn faces and tears from Obama's staff on the day after the election, most have concluded that helping their counterparts succeed remains a critical duty. Obama and Trump themselves have fostered a phone relationship that's weathered bumps in the two months since Election Day. Even after Trump suggested in a tweet the transition was being hampered by Obama administration "roadblocks," the two men appeared to smooth things out during a phone call. In a two-hour meeting over lunch on Wednesday, Trump's incoming senior counselor Kellyanne Conway discussed balancing work and family with Obama's outgoing senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, according to a person with knowledge of the session. They also discussed how to confront the public scrutiny that senior level White House staffers, particularly women, have faced. Conway and Jarrett both occupy critical "whisperer" roles to Trump and Obama; like Jarrett, Conway is expected to carry outsized influence in the West Wing, with access and oversight that goes well beyond a set of policy areas. Conway came away feeling warmly toward Jarrett, according to another source familiar with the two women's meeting. A third described their interactions as "warm" and "cordial." "President Obama's senior staff and our senior staff are working very well together," Conway told CNN last week. Despite deep differences on policy and style, current and former White House aides describe a certain level of apolitical camaraderie among those who have held positions in the West Wing. For most operatives, a posting steps from the Oval Office remains the pinnacle of a political career, despite its grueling hours and relatively modest pay. Presidential transitions haven't always been rosy; when George W. Bush's staff moved into their offices in January 2001, the outgoing aides to President Bill Clinton had removed some of the Ws from the computer keyboards. The shift from Bush to Obama was easier, and Obama's team has lauded the previous Republican administration for their helpfulness in preparing them to govern. "Getting to work at the White House is a genuine honor," White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Wednesday. A day earlier, Earnest and the White House communications director Jen Psaki conferred for several hours in their West Wing offices with Sean Spicer, who's been tapped to perform both roles in Trump's administration. Despite both performing high-level communications jobs in Washington for years, Earnest said it was the first time he'd spoken in-depth with the man who will replace him in a matter of weeks. "We had a long conversation about what it's like to work at the White House. And we certainly talked about some of the complicated logistics of working in this environment, but we also talked a little bit about the approach to the job that Jen and I have taken in fulfilling our roles at this White House," Earnest said. Last month, the outgoing chief of staff Denis McDonough organized a meeting between former top presidential aides and the incoming chief of staff Reince Priebus in his West Wing conference room, a tradition begun during the waning days of Bush's administration. McDonough also counseled Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner in the days immediately following November's election. Kushner, who is expected to play an important role in Trump's White House, was seen strolling in conversation with McDonough around the South Lawn as Obama and Trump met in the Oval Office. Even for jobs not directly responsible for the running of the federal government, the Trump and Obama teams have worked to facilitate the January 20 handoff. Trump's team has worked with Tina Tchen, chief of staff to first lady Michelle Obama, for a transfer of East Wing responsibilities, including official White House correspondence. The White House ushers and curators have begun working with Trump's support staff on personalizing the White House residence, along with the East and West Wings, for Trump. Even the White House swing set, positioned outside the Oval Office windows, became a matter of conversation for the two teams. After the Trump family declined the White House's offer to leave the swings for visiting grandchildren, the wooden set erected in 2009 was donated to a local charity this month. ©While the headlines are coming fast and furious, actual changes to Obamacare will come slower -- much slower.

But after a divisive election season and a campaign rife with rhetoric against Muslims and immigrants, Trump has not attracted a wealth of star power to his Inaugural Ceremony. Plans are far from settled, but as the days until the inauguration tick down, Trump's swearing-in ceremony won't include performances from the big name acts like Beyonce and Yo-Yo Ma who took the stage for President Barack Obama. And for the record, Trump and his team have said they are fine with that. Boris Epshteyn, director of communications for the Inaugural Committee, dismissed the absence of major musicians in an interview on CNN in December. "This is not Woodstock," Epshteyn said. "It's not summer jam. It's not a concert." One evening earlier in December, Trump tweeted his own disdain for high profile celebrities, writing, "The so-called 'A' list celebrities are all wanting tix to the inauguration, but look what they did for Hillary, NOTHING. I want the PEOPLE!" This page will update as the situation changes, but here is who the team has officially announced so far. The marching band "We respect and appreciate how our students and alumni feel about our participation in this parade," said Hawkins. "As many of those who chose to participate in the parade have said, we feel the inauguration of a new president is not a political event but a civil ceremony celebrating the transfer of power." Supporters of the trip argued that the experience would benefit the band -- and be a source of pride for the relatively unknown school. The Inaugural Committee announced in December the Rockettes would bring their iconic New York act to the nation's capital. But in the days and weeks that followed, some degree of controversy emerged. Apparently worried about being associated with the divisive President-elect, several members of the dance group balked at being forced to perform. However, the Several members of the Rockettes came forward to talk about their concerns with the group taking part in the inaugural festivities, and eventually one member leaked a recording to As Dolan tried to explain his decision to have the Rockettes perform for Trump, one dancer said, "It sounds like you're asking us to be tolerant of intolerance." Dolan responded, "Yeah, in a way, I guess we are doing that." Before closing the meeting he offered something in the way of a "sound bite," saying, "We're celebrating a new president, not necessarily this president."

She appeared on the TV contest at just ten years old, eventually making it to second place. Since then she has recorded and released several albums.

Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, in a series of tweets about Obamacare on Thursday. "The Democrats, lead by head clown Chuck Schumer, know how bad ObamaCare is and what a mess they are in. Instead of working to fix it they ... do the typical political thing and BLAME. The fact is ObamaCare was a lie from the beginning. 'Keep you doctor, keep your plan!'" Trump wrote. He continued: "It is ... time for Republicans & Democrats to get together and come up with a healthcare plan that really works - much less expensive & FAR BETTER!" Schumer responded Thursday saying that Trump and the GOP should drop the name calling and focus on health care. "We understand that President-elect Trump is in a difficult spot, that Republicans are in a difficult spot," Schumer said. "They want to repeal ACA and have no idea how to replace it. But instead of calling names, the President-elect should roll up his sleeves and show us a replacement plan that will cover the 20 million Americans who gained coverage, that will cover students, or post-college students 21 to 26 who want to stay on their parents' plan, that will show how we cover people with pre-existing conditions." Trump's sharp rebuke marked a reversal of sorts on Schumer, who earlier in the week found himself answering questions about a In an Still, despite the signs of an early rapprochement, the relationship between the New York pols soured throughout the week as Republicans plunged headlong into the contentious process of repealing Obamacare and unveiled legislation Wednesday to that effect. Schumer slammed the Trump-led Republicans in a Wednesday news conference for pressing forward with the repeal. Flanked by a sign that said "Make America Sick Again," Schumer lit into Republicans for lacking a viable replacement healthcare plan. "Our Republican colleagues don't quite know what to do, they're like the dog who caught the bus. They can repeal, but they have nothing to put in its place," Schumer said Wednesday. "Republicans are plotting, and soon will be executing, a full-scale assault on the three pillars that support the American health care system. The Affordable Care Act, Medicare, and Medicaid. The Republican plan to cut health care wouldn't make America great again, it would make America sick again and lead to chaos instead of affordable care." The fiery rhetoric from Trump and Schumer runs counter to hopes that the two leaders would have a more productive relationship than cross-party partnerships in recent years. Both have well-established reputations as dealmakers, and had signaled a willingness to look for areas of collaboration. Congressional Republicans have forwarded Trump himself has only put forward In an interview on "New Day" on CNN Thursday, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine sounded a more conciliatory tone, urging Democrats and Republicans to work together to improve Obamacare instead of executing a total repeal. "Look, can this law be improved? Can the health care system be improved? Sure it can, and we ought to be working together to do that," Kaine said. "But if they force through a partisan repeal vote and rush into a repeal that strips health insurance away from 30 million Americans and then say, oh, now that we have repealed it, please help us fix the mess that we made -- (President Obama) said don't bail them out of their own problem. The time to work to make improvements is right now, before a repeal vote," Kaine added.

It's just mindless." New York Republican Rep. Chris Collins, a member of Trump's transition executive committee, denounced Biden's response in an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer. "That's a pathetic response," Collins said Thursday on "The Situation Room." "I think it's beneath the Office of the Vice President. It shows just the angst of the loss of this election by (President Barack) Obama, Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden. Donald Trump is the adult in the room." This isn't the first time Biden has been outspoken against Trump. In an interview with CNN in October before the 2016 election, Biden slammed Trump, saying that the Republican presidential nominee "lacks any sensibilities about the American people." "He's not a bad man," Biden said at the time. "But his ignorance is so profound, so profound." ©With just a few days remaining before the Obamas hand over the White House to the Trumps, a new video is giving the public a closer look of the private residences at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. In a video released by The White House, the design and decor put into place by the current first family is put on display as President Barack Obama narrates, describing what it is like to live within such hallowed halls.

His position, conveyed via Twitter, sent various intelligence officials and hawkish public figures reeling. "Somebody needs to march into his office and explain who Julian Assange is," former House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers, a Republican and CNN contributor, offered Wednesday, in the wake of the controversy. Assange has cast a wide, blurry shadow over the center of US politics from his seclusion in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he remains holed up to avoid facing sexual assault charges in Sweden and a potential extradition to the United States. And just days before Trump takes office, Assange has become a dividing line in the GOP's emerging intra-party fight over national security. On Thursday, Trump But many Republicans have made up their minds about Assange and reached the opposite conclusion as Trump. "I have really nothing (to say) other than the guy is a sycophant for Russia. He leaks. He steals data and compromises national security," said House Speaker Paul Ryan when asked about Assange on Hugh Hewitt's radio show Wednesday morning. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain asked Director of National Intelligence James Clapper during Thursday's hearing on Russia's alleged hacks: "Do you think that there's any credibility we should attach to this individual?" "Not in my view," Clapper said. So who is Julian Assange? WikiLeaks is the self-styled "radical transparency" organization Assange It was set up as a repository and distributor of leaked information, vowing to uphold the anonymity of its sources. In 2007-2008, it posted a wide range of materials from Guantanamo Bay, the Church of Scientology and some of 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin's stolen emails. In 2010, WikiLeaks made available a classified video of a 2007 US helicopter attack killing civilians and journalists in Iraq. The video, known as "Collateral Murder," generated an uproar from human rights activists against the US for killing innocent people and from US defense officials against WikiLeaks for generating anti-US sentiment. The US military detained Army Pvt. Chelsea Manning, then known as Bradley Manning, for sending the footage to WikiLeaks. Over the next few months, WikiLeaks published hundreds of thousands of classified military documents and State Department cables. When the Swedish government pursued sexual assault charges against Assange in 2010, several members of WikiLeaks called for him WikiLeaks continued for years to release millions of documents, including emails from Stratfor -- a global intelligence company -- and Syrian politicians, before lying relatively low for years. Then in July 2016, WikiLeaks launched itself into the middle of the US presidential election when it posted thousands of emails from the Democratic National Committee just days before the party's nominating convention began. The emails from several senior staffers demonstrated bias against Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in favor of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton during the primary and threatened to throw the entire convention into turmoil. Before the weekend was out, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz said she would resign her position as chairwoman of the DNC. But WikiLeaks' part in the election was not yet over: A month ahead of Election Day, the organization began posting emails from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. The steady release of emails brought renewed scrutiny to Clinton and her inner circle, particularly regarding the controversy over her use of a private email server to conduct State Department business. The US government said Russia was behind the hacks that led to both of these document dumps, an allegation Assange has denied. Born in 1971, the His espoused views against the power structures of Western government and corporate behemoths made up the public persona of the organization, one that became inseparable from Assange himself. As WikiLeaks' dumps quickly reached the hundreds of thousands, the sheer volume of documents Assange's organization released, along with his provocative statements, made him a famous -- or infamous -- figure on the international stage. Then at the height of WikiLeaks' largest drop ever, during the Assange resided in London as the charges progressed and submitted himself to UK authorities. He was taken into custody and then put under house arrest. Sweden called for his extradition from the United Kingdom, a request Assange took to the UK Supreme Court. About two years into this process, Ecuador used its diplomatic authority to grant Assange asylum. While this afforded Assange the ability to stave off going to Sweden, where he risked prison time over the sexual assault charges, it left him stuck in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he remains to this day as he continues his leadership of WikiLeaks and navigates the criminal process facing him. Well before he was accused of sexual assault, Assange faced the ire of people the world over. Some argued WikiLeaks' use of stolen documents was unethical and others said its disclosures harmed the national security of countries involved. Others argued Assange had an immoral, anti-American agenda. A more nuanced debate grew out of those sympathetic with Assange's aims over whether what WikiLeaks was doing constituted journalism. Assange has regularly argued WikiLeaks is a journalistic organization, performing a journalism function through its leaks. But others, including former media partners of Assange, The New York Times and the Guardian, viewed WikiLeaks as a source for information, rather than a news outlet. Although WikiLeaks once worked with those organizations in advance of publishing documents, it has since moved to make its findings available on its site, without a media partner or intermediary such as The Times. Many journalists and advocates said massive document troves must be sorted through before they are released so as to avoid the unneeded exposure of personal information potentially put people in harms way. In the face of WikiLeaks' 2010 disclosures, a Assange has asserted his organization's actions have not put people in harm's way. But other leakers have argued against the mass dumps Assange favors. Edward Snowden, the man behind the National Security Agency leaks, worked with journalists Laura Poitras and Glenn Greenwald for the stated reason of avoiding improper information going out alongside newsworthy documents. Even though WikiLeaks helped Snowden to find safe harbor in Russia, the former contractor took to Twitter in the summer of 2016 to make the argument in favor of "curation" over massive data dumps. WikiLeaks fired back, accusing Snowden of cozying up to the Democratic Party for a pardon. In the years since WikiLeaks' founding, Assange has built a massive global backing. The independent organization is able to fund itself off the donations of its supporters and its online following stands in the millions. Its supporters used to come from largely left-leaning circles, human rights groups opposed to the Western military-industrial complex and the power of a handful of US corporations, like Google. Meanwhile, national security hawks of all political stripes had for years railed against him. Even Trump in 2010 on But by 2016, as WikiLeaks' disclosures of the DNC and Podesta emails took its toll on Democratic Party unity and Clinton's poll numbers, major Republican figures turned around. Trump said he "loved" WikiLeaks at an October campaign rally, and Fox News commentator Sean Hannity praised Assange repeatedly. Following Assange's recent sit-down interview with Hannity, Palin -- once the target of a WikiLeaks disclosure -- apologized to the WikiLeaks founder and threw in a recommendation for Oliver Stone's movie "Snowden." The US intelligence community has uniformly said the Russian government was behind the Democratic Party hacks and is the source of WikiLeaks' blockbuster 2016 disclosures. Assange has denied this, but the US government has said it is certain, and a private cybersecurity group called Crowdstrike has also said Russia was behind the hacks. The declassified version of the Intelligence Community's comprehensive review ordered by President Barack Obama into hacks connected to the US election is expected to be released Monday, US officials told CNN. And accusers have pointed to Assange's regular appearances on Russia's English-language news channel RT -- where he hosted a show -- as well as WikiLeaks' lack of Russian disclosures and role in delivering Snowden in Moscow as evidence of their collusion. In a In a ©An infantry battalion at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina received three historic additions Thursday -- the first women infantry Marines. The three women will serve in the 1st Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment, with specializations as rifleman, machine gun and mortar, according to 1st Lt. John McCombs, a Marines spokesman. The identities of the women are not being released at this time to allow them to get acclimated to their unit, McCombs said. The unit already has three females in leadership roles and they will be able to help with the transition, he noted. Women had not been allowed to participate in certain military roles until Women have been working to fight alongside men for more than 150 years, according to the US military -- going as far back as the Civil War where more than 400 women disguised themselves as men. As a new administration readies to take over, it is unclear how Donald Trump will handle the role of women in the military. In August 2015, Trump tweeted a comment in 2013 that appeared to raise doubts about women serving. "26,000 unreported sexual assaults in the military-only 238 convictions. What did these geniuses expect when they put men & women together?" Trump wrote. When asked about the remark during a campaign forum in September, Trump stood by it. "I think that that's absolutely correct," Trump clarified that he did not think the solution was to take women out of the equation completely. "But something has to happen," Trump said. "Right now, part of the problem is nobody gets prosecuted. You have reported ... you have the report of rape and nobody gets prosecuted." Trump's nominee for defense secretary, retired Gen. James Mattis, has made comments suggesting he is wary about female integration into infantry and special operations roles where there is what he called "intimate killing." "When you have to reduce standards -- as you would have to do, you would have to do it -- and when you would mix, you know, when you mix eros, when you mix affection for one another that could be manifested sexually, I don't care if you go anywhere in history, you will not find where this has worked. Never has this worked," "We have had numerous cases where you have put healthy young men and women together and you expect them to act like little saints," Mattis added. On Wednesday, Mattis met with New York Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand to talk about the value of women in the military. When Gillibrand was asked if she had any policy disagreements with Trump's nominee, she responded: "I do have concerns about the role of women in the military and how sexual assault in the military will be addressed, but I'll ask those questions in the hearing specifically so he can answer them for the record and then make a decision." Gillibrand has been a fierce advocate of military sexual assault prevention legislation in Congress and has worked to change how reports of sexual assaults are handled.

Legislative moves this week in Kentucky, Minnesota, Missouri, Texas and Virginia represent the latest efforts at the center of a broader public debate over transgender rights. Additionally, lawmakers in Alabama, South Carolina and Washington filed so-called bathroom bills last year for introduction during the upcoming sessions. Since 2013, at least 24 states have considered restricting access to restrooms, locker rooms and other facilities on the basis of biological sex, according to the The American Civil Liberties Union in May filed a lawsuit challenging Mississippi's religious freedom law, which critics say will discriminate against gay and transgender people. Part of the law, known as North Carolina is the Already, backlash against House Bill 2, the Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act, has caused huge economic losses for the state, such as businesses canceling plans to expand and the NBA moving its All-Star game from Charlotte to another city. The economic costs, however, have not deterred other states from following suit: Only three days into 2017, House Bill 106 was introduced in the Legislature. The bill would require bathrooms in public buildings "only be used by persons based on their biological sex." Groups such as the On Thursday, House Bill 41 was introduced. It would require "all school restrooms, locker rooms, shower rooms, and changing rooms for use by multiple students be designated for and used by male or female students only. Defines sex as being determined by chromosomes and sex assigned at birth." The bill would allow "schools to provide separate accommodations (single-stall facilities or faculty facilities) in special circumstances." Senate Bill 98, introduced Wednesday, would similarly require "all school restrooms, locker rooms, and shower rooms accessible for use by multiple students be designated for and used by male or female students only." House Bill 202 would require "all public restrooms, other than single occupancy restrooms, to be gender-divided." House Bill 6 was prefiled before the regular legislative session begins. Known as the "Texas Privacy Act" and pushed by Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, the bill would prohibit local governments from adopting ordinances regulating bathroom and locker room access of private businesses. In addition, dressing rooms, locker rooms and bathrooms in government buildings and public schools and universities must be designated for use based on a person's biological sex -- as listed on the birth certificate. Chase Strangio, House Bill 1612, introduced Tuesday, would requires that a government entity provide for members of the opposite sex separate restrooms and other facilities, and prohibits a person from entering a restroom or other facility designated for use by members of the opposite sex. The controversial bills come after the A letter from the departments of Education and Justice was sent with guidelines to ensure that "transgender students enjoy a supportive and nondiscriminatory school environment," the Obama administration said.

Servers don white gloves to facilitate tastings of wine "by the crystal spoon," poured out in one-ounce portions, and sipped through the handle, per Hungarian tradition. The least expensive option runs $15 for the ounce. For a more festive evening, bartenders will roll up a cart of champagne and teach guests to saber the lid with a large knife.

Not surprisingly, there are no happy hour drink specials. But early birds can get half off "grilled country bread" appetizers from 4 to 6 p.m. Pricing and vacancy rates for the hotel, which Trump officially opened less than two weeks before the election, indicated the hotel may have initially been slow to book. In mid-October, a CNNMoney report found rooms at $505 a night, well pricier than comparable competitors. However, those numbers aren't always a perfect indicator, and Mickael Damelincourt, the property's managing director, said it was the most successful opening he's seen in 10 years working for Trump hotels. Since the grand opening and Trump's November win, the hotel's profile has been raised considerably, with new questions as to how the new administration will handle potential conflicts of interest if foreign leaders stay at the hotel as a way of ingratiating themselves with the highest levels of the American government.

The meeting comes at the end of a week in which Trump's public skepticism over evidence Russia interfered in the US political process has pitted him against the country's top spy chiefs and high profile lawmakers in both parties. Trump will sit down with James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, as well as several other leading agency heads, the day after a With just two weeks until his inauguration, there are concerns over Trump's seeming refusal to give more credence to the views of leading US intelligence agencies than to those of Russian President Vladimir Putin and WikiLeaks fugitive Julian Assange. The drama has even caused outgoing Vice President Joe Biden to tell the President-elect On Thursday, Clapper laid bare both his concerns and those of his colleagues at the President-elect's views of the US intelligence community. Speaking at a hearing on global cyberthreats that focused almost exclusively on Moscow's alleged hacking during the presidential elections, he said there was a difference between "skepticism and disparagement." "I do think public trust and confidence in the intelligence community is crucial both in the US and in other countries that rely on US intelligence," he said. "I've received many expressions of concern from foreign counterparts about the disparagement of the US Intelligence Community, or I should say, what has been interpreted as disparagement of the US intelligence community." As officials try to make sense of Trump's skepticism, one theory is that the President-elect is concerned that his victory is being undermined by allegations that Russia tried to affect the 2016 vote. Republican John McCain, the committee chairman, emphasized the Russian role and delivered an implicit rebuke to Trump, who has urged people to "move on" from the issue of Moscow-directed hacking. "Every American should be alarmed by Russia's attacks on our nation," he said. "There's no escaping the fact that this committee meets today ... in the aftermath of an unprecedented attack on our democracy." During the hearing -- a rare show of bipartisan unity in Washington -- Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal said Trump's "demeaning and dismissive" comments about intelligence officers were unacceptable, and praised their service. On Thursday, US intelligence identified the go-betweens the Russians used to provide stolen emails to WikiLeaks, according to US officials familiar with the classified intelligence report that was presented to President Obama. The new information has given agencies increased confidence that Russia carried out the hack and did so, in part, to help Trump win. Included in that new information were intercepted conversations of Russian officials expressing happiness at Trump's win. Another official described some of the messages as congratulatory. Officials said this was just one of multiple indicators to give them high confidence of both Russian involvement and Russian intentions. Officials reiterated that there is no single intercepted communication that qualifies as a "smoking gun" on Russia's intention to benefit Trump's candidacy or to claim credit for doing so. Trump has been prolific on Last week, Trump suggested that intelligence officials postponed an "'intelligence' briefing on so-called 'Russian hacking'" that they were set to deliver to him this week because they might need more time "to build a case." He called the alleged delay "very strange." Trump has also faced criticism for appearing to back claims made by WikiLeaks founder Assange, who said Russia wasn't the source of stolen documents from the Democratic National Committee (DNC) that his group distributed. Trump rejected those accusations, tweeting: "The dishonest media likes saying that I am in agreement with Julian Assange - wrong. I simply state what he states, it is for the people to make up their own minds as to the truth. The media lies to make it look like I am against "Intelligence" when in fact I am a big fan!" Trump also questioned claims by the Democratic Party that their computer servers had been hacked, adding: "How and why are they so sure about hacking if they never even requested an examination of the computer servers? What is going on?" Before the election, when 17 US intelligence agencies issued a public statement concluding that Russia orchestrated the hack of the DNC, Trump immediately cast doubt on those conclusions, arguing it was impossible to distinguish between a Russian government operative and " After Obama placed a series of sanctions on Russia, Trump issued a statement calling for the country to "move on to bigger and better things" and then tweeted praise for Vladimir Putin for not retaliating against the sanctions. Earlier this week, State Department Spokesman John Kirby told CNN that the US administration is "is 100% certain in the role that Russia played" in election-related hacking. "There's no question" about what Russia did to "sow doubt and confusion, and getting involved through the cyber domain, into our electoral process," "And that's not just an assessment by the President or by [Secretary of State John Kerry] or other Cabinet officials. It's an assessment by the entire intelligence community. Speaking to WMAQ in Chicago Thursday, Obama said it was "important" Trump and the intelligence community work together. "My hope is that when the President-elect receives his own briefings and is able to examine the intelligence as his team has put together and they see how professional and effective these agencies are, that some of those current tensions will be reduced," Obama said. "I can speak to my own experience -- it's going to be important to make sure the President and the intelligence communities are both working on the best possible information." Russia has consistently Kremlin spokesman Dmitr Peskov told CNN that Moscow is "sick and tired of those irresponsibly blaming everything on our country. If there is a need for an enemy, why not to try someone else?" "We have suggested cooperation on combating cyberthreats numerous times," Peskov said. "It was rejected." Aleksey Pushkov, head of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the State Duma, took to Twitter to criticize the US intelligence community. "When authorities of a country that created more fake news than the rest of the world, blame Russia for doing that, it's clear: it's one more gigantic fake," he wrote. "Maybe the main battle for Trump won't be China or North Korea or ISIS. It will be with American mass media that continue an information war against him."

Many Republicans on Capitol Hill are not so sure. In interviews with CNN, a number of Republicans suggested that Trump's claim amounted to wishful thinking, saying they believed the billionaire businessman would ultimately backtrack on one of his central campaign promises. "I doubt that they're going to pay for it," said Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, the longest-serving Senate Republican, referring to Mexico. "There's a lot he could do if he wanted to (force Mexico's hand). In all honesty, I don't think that's going to happen." Rep. Mike Coffman, a Colorado Republican, added: "I never thought that would happen. I thought it was a gimmick." And some conservatives warned Trump would face a backlash if he failed to follow through. "I'm for building a wall," said Rep. Mo Brooks of Alabama. "And I'm for Donald Trump keeping his promise to the American people that Mexico pay for it." He added that he would be "disappointed" if Trump failed to deliver. House GOP sources tell CNN that Trump's transition team Trump insists his rhetoric is no gimmick, telling The New York Times Friday that Mexico will reimburse the United States, using negotiations over revamping the North American Free Trade Agreement as leverage against the country. He has also previously warned of imposing punitive measures on Mexico if the country does not comply. "We're going to get reimbursed," Trump said. "But I don't want to wait that long. But you start, and then you get reimbursed." Top Republican leaders were cautious in their assessment, including Texas Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican. "Well right now, they're pretty uncertain as to what all of this means," Cornyn said of his constituents in his border state. He said he urged Trump's nominee for secretary of the treasury, Steve Mnuchin, to "make sure there aren't any unintended consequences of this." "About 6 million American jobs depend on cross-border trade with Mexico," Cornyn told CNN. Some House conservatives also were skeptical. Asked if he believed that Trump would succeed in persuading Mexico to pay for the wall, Rep. Dave Brat of Virginia said: "Not in some big, they're going to hand us a big check kind-of-way." But he added: "There'll be a policy in place where we can compensate the cost they're imposing." Even getting the funding bill through Congress could be difficult. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Friday the plan would be a "tough sell" to Democrats. And Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is waiting to discuss the matter more fully with his caucus, but he'd have the power to block the measure in the Senate if he kept Senate Democrats largely in line against it. But if Congress ends up stuck with the tab, it's clear some conservatives may not be happy. "I'm for securing the border for the American people, and we're going to be sure we get that done," said Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus. Asked if that meant he'd support Trump's plan to have Congress pay for it first, Jordan deadpanned: "I didn't say that." And he walked into an elevator.

President-elect Donald Trump's 304 electoral votes weren't counted without incident, however. During the course of the certification, House Democrats tried to object to electoral votes from multiples states, with Biden gaveling them down for failure to follow the rules. Objections to the votes needed to be in writing and signed by both a member of the House and a member of the Senate. Every House member who rose to object did so without a senator's signature. "The electors were not lawfully certified, especially given the confirmed and illegal activities engaged by the government of Russia," McGovern said. Biden denied McGovern on the grounds that he didn't have a senator's signature on his written objection. "They violated Florida's prohibition against dual office holders," Raskin said. Again, despite the fact that Raskin pointed out that he had his objection in writing, he failed to get a senator's signature. "It is over," Biden told the congresswoman. "People are horrified by the overwhelming evidence of Russian interference in our election," Lee said. Once again, her objection was denied for the lack of a senator's signature. They also turned off her microphone. "I object on the massive voter suppression that included --" Jackson Lee began. "The debate is not in order," Biden interrupted. Again, the congresswoman lacked a senator's signature. As you may have guessed, he didn't have the signature of a senator. Once he gave up, Jackson Lee tagged him out and tried to object to the votes herself. They cut off her microphone, too. "There is no debate. There is no debate. There is no debate," a visibly agitated Biden said as he gaveled. "There is no debate in the joint session," Biden said, shutting her down once more. They cut off her microphone again. Jackson Lee once again tried to make an objection on the grounds of Russian interference in the election. "The objection cannot be received," Biden said. Taking a play from her own book -- she objected to the certification of George W. Bush's 2000 election -- Waters admitted that she didn't have a senator's signature on her objection. "I wish to ask: Is there one United States senator who will join me in this letter of objection?" Waters asked.

But at the end of the day, despite the objections, Trump's election was certified by Congress. ©Donald Trump was formally certified as the winner of the presidential election Friday, after handful of congressman tried to object during the tally of Electoral College votes, a desperate gambit quickly squashed by Vice President Joe Biden. Vice President Joe Biden repeatedly told objecting congressman that their attempt to disrupt the usually staid moment that their objections were invalid because they did not have the signature of a United States senator. Biden, at times exasperated by the scene, at one point cautioned his fellow Democrats: "It is over." "There is no debate. There is no debate. There is no debate," Biden repeated to Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, one of the frequent objectors in the Capitol. At least three protestors were swiftly removed by security when shouting during the certification. US Capitol Police spokeswoman Eva Malecki told CNN they arrested two males and one female and says they are being processed at U.S. Capitol Police Headquarters. They will release more information on charges later today. Leaving the chamber, Republican Sen. John Cornyn said he thought the protests were "kind of embarrassing." Those upset by the vote tried to voice their displeasure with everything from alleged voting machine malfunctions to claims of "massive voter suppression" to worries about hackings from Russia. But Biden talked over each of their speeches unless they could produce a signature. "We thought it was very important that we at least acknowledge the obvious," Jackson Lee told reporters, "the obvious was that there were absolute violations, absolute failures in the Democratic process in the 2016 election and most hideous and most glaring was the documented intrusion of Vladimir Putin in the 2016 election for one candidate over another." Trump received 304 electoral votes when electors gathered at state capitols in December to formally cast their ballots. Hillary Clinton received 227. Seven "faithless" electors voted for other candidates, costing Trump two votes and Clinton four. Trump will be officially sworn in January 20.

The campaign -- which consisted of hacking Democratic groups and individuals, including Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, and releasing that information via third-party websites, including WikiLeaks -- amounted to what the intelligence report called "a significant escalation" in longtime Russian efforts to undermine "the US-led liberal democratic order." The "We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election. Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump," the report said. "Russian efforts to influence the 2016 US presidential election represent the most recent expression of Moscow's longstanding desire to undermine the US-led liberal democratic order, but these activities demonstrated a significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and scope of effort compared to previous operations," the report continued. The report said Moscow used a variety of tactics in a bid to sway the outcome. "Moscow's influence campaign followed a Russian messaging strategy that blends covert intelligence operations -- such as cyberactivity -- with overt efforts by Russian government agencies, state-funded media, third-party intermediaries and paid social media users or 'trolls,' " the report found. The US intelligence community released several new pieces of information to support its conclusions. It noted that in the final run-up to the election, when polls favored Clinton to win the election, Moscow shifted its campaign to influence the election to one aimed at undermining the validity of the electoral results. "Before the election, Russian diplomats had already publicly denounced the US electoral process and were prepared to publicly call into question the validity of the results," the reported stated, adding that pro-Russian government bloggers had prepared a Twitter campaign on Election Night using the hashtag "#DemocracyRIP." US intelligence officials also assessed "with high confidence" that the GRU Russian intelligence agency "used the Guccifer 2.0 persona, DCLeaks.com, and WikiLeaks to release US victim data obtained in cyberoperations publicly." The intelligence community also assessed "with high confidence" that the GRU provided WikiLeaks with the material they obtained from hacking the Democratic National Committee and top Democratic officials. US intelligence agencies also noted in the report that the Russian influence campaign was not limited to the cyberhacking and release of private documents that drew headlines during the presidential campaign. The report stated that the campaign blended cyberhacking intelligence operations with overt propaganda efforts carried out by state-owned media outlets and paid social media users. The propaganda efforts included Russian state-owned media outlets like Russia Today and Sputnik casting Trump as "the target of unfair coverage from traditional US media outlets" as well as Russian propaganda officials casting Trump during the campaign as a victim of the US political establishment. Meanwhile, the intelligence community noted that "RT's coverage of Secretary Clinton ... was consistently negative and focused on her leaked emails and accused her of corruption, poor physical and mental health, and ties to Islamic extremism." Clinton's campaign first argued Russia was aiming to help Trump back in July, to which Trump's campaign called the comment "a joke." After the election, Clinton argued to donors that Putin got involved in the 2016 election partially due to a grudge against her, a view that's backed up in Friday's report. "Putin most likely wanted to discredit Secretary Clinton because he has publicly blamed her since 2011 for inciting mass protests against his regime in late 2011 and early 2012, and because he holds a grudge for comments he almost certainly saw as disparaging him," the report said. The Clinton campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday. But Jesse Lehrich, a spokesman for Clinton's campaign, expressed vindication Friday afternoon, tweeting: "every day: REPORTER: what about *this* @wikileaks email? ME: part of an unprecedented foreign cyberattack!!! REPORTER: so... no comment?" And Robby Mook, Clinton's campaign manager, asked on Twitter, "What is stopping PEOTUS from accepting intel community's findings? Until he accepts them, he is effectively siding w/ Putin over U.S." The report, which was commissioned by President Barack Obama, comes as Trump has continued to resist the US intelligence community's conclusions that Russia was responsible for the hacking and that it aimed to help his campaign. Trump was briefed earlier Friday on the report by top US intelligence and law enforcement officials, and while he said he had "a constructive meeting," he declined to publicly agree with their conclusions. Instead, Trump stressed that "there was absolutely no effect on the outcome whatsoever," which the US intelligence community asserted in its report it was not in a position to assess. Trump did acknowledge in his statement the possibility that Russia could have been behind the hack, though he named China as well as a persistent cyberhacker. The US intelligence community also warned in its report Friday that Moscow would likely continue to pursue cyberhacking campaigns to influence future elections. "Moscow will apply lessons learned from its Putin-ordered campaign aimed at the US presidential election to future influence efforts worldwide, including against US allies and their election processes," it assessed. The 17 US intelligence agencies first concluded in October that Russian intelligence, directed by the most senior Russian officials, orchestrated the hacking of Democratic Party organizations. But since then, the US intelligence community said it had gathered additional information to make assessments of the motivations behind the cyberhacking operations: that the effort was aimed at undermining the US democratic process, hurting Clinton and helping Trump in the 2016 presidential election.

"Remember, the moment you mention Russian hacking and the election, the same sentence, you know what the impression is for a lot of the viewers," she told CNN's Chris Cuomo in a contentious interview on CNN's "New Day." Trump's former campaign adviser also said Hillary Clinton's team continues to suggest that Russia wanted Trump to beat the Democratic presidential nominee. "I really believe that there are those out there who are trying to delegitimize his presidency, review the election results, and you know it," she said. US intelligence agencies have consistently said they have evidence showing the Russian government attempted to influence the 2016 president election through cyberhacking. But Conway denies the suggestion that Russia wanted Trump to win. "The Russians didn't want him elected, because he has said very clearly during the campaign and now as President-elect that he is going to modernize our nuclear capability, he's going to call for an increase in defense budget, he's going to have oil and gas exploration -- all which goes against Russia's economic and military interests," she said. "Donald Trump got elected in part because people want a tougher leader in the White House, a tougher Commander-in-Chief," Conway added. Trump has been criticized for giving credence to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who said his hacked information did not come from Russia. Trump and his Vice President-elect Mike Pence are scheduled to receive a security briefing Friday. Conway said Trump and his team respect the intelligence community, but that they have not provided conclusive evidence on the alleged hacking. "The idea that somehow conclusive evidence has been out there in the public domain provided to the President-elect is simply not true," she said. "And the other thing that's going on here that's very disappointing to us in this building is how much people are conflating alleged Russian hacking with the actual outcome of the election. It's just nonsense." Conway said any suggestion that Trump is trying to shelter Russia is unfair. "Here is the deal. The President-elect and all of us who work for him and the Vice President-elect, I assure you, are against any foreign interference in the United States of America including through cybersecurity, which obviously has not been a big priority for the last eight years. maybe that will change," she said.

And it involves President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for attorney general, Jeff Sessions. The year was 1985 and Sessions, then a US attorney, prosecuted an infamous voter fraud case that captured the nation's attention, and had civil rights leaders rallying behind the accused. Known as the "Marion Three," Turner, her husband Albert, and Spencer Hogue Jr. faced dozens of charges that their attorneys said were racially motivated. Session's office disputed that, then and now. Today, at 80 years old, Turner doesn't hold back her feelings. "I hate him just that bad," she told CNN. "And he shouldn't be up for anything, not even a dog catcher." Albert Turner Sr. was a civil rights activist who marched with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. from Selma to Montgomery in 1965. He was King's field director in Alabama, and began building political power in the black community in Perry County, Alabama, where he formed the Perry County Civic League at a time when segregation was the norm. Evelyn Turner said her husband was devoted to registering blacks to vote, getting more political representation for minorities, more services, and she says, he frequently ran into opposition from the politicians who were used to having Perry County run by their own rules. "They didn't want us to be in charge because there's more black folks in Perry County than there is white," Turner said, adding her husband "just wanted equal rights for all citizens." In January 1985, the Turners and Hogue were indicted by a grand jury on 29 separate counts for allegedly altering absentee ballots in favor of candidates supported by the Perry County Civic League during the September 1984 Democratic primary. Court documents filed by the defense said "this is a "one-sided investigation" designed to intimidate Black voters." Civil rights advocates called for the charges to be dropped. Sessions filed court documents at the time denying any nefarious motive: "[A]n effort has been made ... to create the impression that this investigation is unfounded or racially motivated. These allegations are false and can only be construed as a part of an effort to poison the jury pool and to attempt to cause witnesses to be reluctant to testify." A jury deliberated about four hours and found all three of the accused not guilty. Turner's voice became emotional when she talked about Sessions becoming attorney general. "Sessions has not changed. Have you ever known a leopard to change his spots? I haven't.... Sessions is still a racist." Sessions, who went on to become attorney general of Alabama before being elected to the US Senate, would later explain that his two-lawyer federal prosecution team was understaffed and unprepared to handle the vigorous defense. Some witnesses who previously told investigators their ballots had been tampered with changed their testimony when speaking to the jury. During Sessions' 1986 Senate confirmation hearing to become a federal judge, he denied the case was selective prosecution. And today, his spokesperson says the prosecution was an example of the US justice system functioning properly, pointing out that the Marion Three were indicted by a mostly-black grand jury. Sessions was "bringing this case on behalf of officials in his state who thought that an election wasn't fair," said Sarah Isgur Flores, who noted the original voter-fraud complaints came from local black officials who contested election results. "So he went forward and a majority of the jury, their peers, found them innocent. The system worked." Flores adds that the fact that Sessions proceeded with a controversial case is a testament to him. "I think it would have been unfortunate had that case not been brought simply because there were black civil rights activists involved," she said. And there's another unlikely advocate for Sessions -- the son of Albert and Evelyn Turner. Albert Turner Jr., took over his father's seat on the Perry County Commission after his father's death in 2000, and he is a vocal supporter of Sessions. "In my opinion, he's not a racist," Turner said. "In my dealings with him, I have not seen racist tendencies or biases from Sen. Sessions." He blames the case on influential black officials and a white district attorney who launched an investigation that contributed to the federal case. "You had blacks who didn't like my father, who you know, felt that he was too influential in this community when it came to politics and other aspects of Perry County's life, and they sought to make sure his influence was diminished by putting him in jail," Turner said. Last year, Evelyn Turner saw Sessions at a ceremony in Washington honoring the foot soldiers who marched from Selma. Sessions had sponsored the legislation to bestow the honors and helped set up the event. But when Sessions went over to give her a hug, she backed off. "He never said, 'I'm sorry Miss Turner I put you through that. That it was my job.' He hasn't told me that. Then why should I forgive him? But I know in order for me to get to heaven, I know I'm gonna have to forgive him, but I'll never forget as long as I stay black. I will not forget."

James Mattis, the President-elect's choice for secretary of defense, over the transition selecting a secretary of the Army without his input, several sources told CNN. Mattis was angry and threatened to quit if the transition tried to appoint more people without him, one of the sources said. Vice President-elect Mike Pence had to talk to Mattis and smooth things over, the source added. The Washington Post first reported the disagreement. Trump's incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer disputed the story in a Tweet Friday morning, writing, "Great transition at DoD. Reports to contrary completely false and come from sources who do not have any knowledge of our transition efforts." Mattis was unhappy that the team decided on businessman Vincent Viola without consulting him. He also expressed concern after learning of questionable stock trading practices in Viola's trading firm, one source said. The source said Mattis was told ahead of the appointment but thought the trading issue should have been raised before the announcement. Mattis himself wanted Michele Flournoy for a high-level position, according to two people familiar with the matter. Flournoy was formerly undersecretary for policy under President Barack Obama and was widely believed to be a top contender to be defense secretary had Hillary Clinton won. Flournoy had preliminary conversations with Mattis and went to New York to brief people on the Trump team on her work on defense and National Security Council reform but withdrew her name from any consideration in mid-December. Mattis wants a very strong voice in Defense picks and does not want to be limited by the political affiliation of potential nominees, said the same source. According to another source, who is familiar with the Trump transition, Mattis in the end comes out with a stronger say in choosing whom he wants for the other positions, despite the bumpy start.

"Sr Trump,the intelligence report is devastating. Losing election by more than 3M votes and in addition this.Are you a legitimate president?" Fox tweeted Friday night. Fox's jab at Trump comes after the US intelligence community concluded in a declassified report released that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an "influence campaign" aimed at hurting Hillary Clinton and helping Trump. In addition to that, Trump lost the popular vote to Clinton by 2.9 million votes -- not more than 3 million votes, as Fox said in his tweet -- which has been something of a touchy subject for Trump, who has cited his Electoral College lead to highlight his win. Fox also slammed Trump after he said that he is planning to have Mexico reimburse US taxpayers for his campaign promise to build a border wall between the US and Mexico. Fox tweeted, "TRUMP, when will you understand that I am not paying for that f------ wall. Be clear with US tax payers. They will pay for it." And on Thursday, Fox tweeted, "Trump may ask whoever he wants, but still neither myself nor Mexico are going to pay for his racist monument. Another promise he can't keep." Trump Fox was not the only former Mexican president tweeting at Trump on Friday. Felipe Calderon tweeted, "To @realDonaldTrump : The more jobs you destroy in Mexico, the more immigrants the American people will have. Think a little!" Trump's transition team did not immediately respond to CNN for a request to comment on the tweets. Fox was one of Trump's harshest critics during the 2016 election. During Trump's campaign, he called him a "false prophet" and said the then-Republican nominee heralded the return "to the era of the ugly American" during an interview in May. And most famously, Fox cursed on live television in February while talking about Trump and his proposed border wall, telling Fox Business, "I'm not going to pay for that f---ing wall."

"I want our young people to know that they matter, that they belong," Obama said, her voice breaking several times near the end of her remarks. "So don't be afraid. You hear me, young people? Don't be afraid. Be focused. Be determined. Be hopeful. Be empowered. Empower yourself with a good education. Then get out there and use that education to build a country worthy of you boundless promise. Lead by example with hope; never fear." The event aimed at honoring the 2017 School Counselor of the Year comes exactly two weeks before President-elect Donald Trump assumes office. The ceremony, which Obama initiated in 2015, highlights high school counselors who have demonstrated leadership skills. It's part of her "Reach Higher" program to promote higher education. In her time at the White House, Obama has championed education, fitness, and military families, often using the East Room or the South Lawn to speak out on her chosen topics. She's also hosted musical and theater performances at the White House, inviting students from Washington schools to partake in cultural events they may not have otherwise experienced. During last year's political campaign, she also spoke out forcefully against Trump, arguing in passionate remarks that his comments about women had shaken her. As she leaves the White House, the first lady has described what she'll miss, including the hyper-attentive personal staff and the sense of history. "You know, there are little ... moments," she told Vogue in November. "Even today, I was looking out at this view here. Looking out on the South Lawn and the Washington Monument and it had just rained and the grass was really green and everything popped a little bit more. It's so beautiful. And for that moment I thought, I'm going to miss waking up to this, having access to this anytime I want." But, she told the magazine, "it's time." Friday's event won't be the final time the public will be able to hear from the first lady, however. She'll make her final late night show appearance next Wednesday on "The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon."

"Over the years, the President and first lady have on occasion -- not frequently, but on occasion -- they've hosted parties at the White House for their friends," Earnest said. "And I anticipate this will be the last one that they have. They've got some packing to do."

"If it works, I'm for it," Obama said during an interview with Vox, adding he would only support a Republican plan if it contains the protections that he included in the Affordable Care Act, such as barring insurance companies from withholding coverage for Americans with pre-existing conditions. "If you can do all that cheaper than we talked about, cheaper than Obamacare achieves, and with better quality and it's just terrific, I'm for it," Obama said. Republicans in Congress are weighing their options for how to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, though no one, clear alternative has emerged as a consensus plan from the GOP. Obama insisted he's always remained open to alternate options than what's contained in his law, which passed on a narrow partisan basis in 2010. "From the very start, in the earliest negotiations in 2009 and 2010, I made clear to Republicans that if they had ideas that they could show would work better than the ideas we have thought of, I would be happy to incorporate item into the law. And rather than ideas, all we got was a big 'No,'" Obama said. "Now is the time when Republicans have to go ahead and show their cards. If in fact they have a program that would genuinely work better - they can call it whatever they want, they can call it Trumpcare, they can call it McConnellcare, they can call it Ryancare - if it works, I will be the first to say great," he said. "Now is the time when Republicans have to go ahead and show their cards. If in fact they have a program that would genuinely work better - they can call it whatever they want, they can call it Trumpcare, they can call it McConnellcare, they can call it Ryancare - if it works, I will be the first to say great," he said. ©Republicans are unanimous in their desire to "repeal and replace" President Barack Obama's signature health care law -- but they are already flirting with not having the 50 votes needed to pass the bill in the Senate. Republicans have 52 seats in the Senate, meaning they can only afford to lose three members of their caucus before they cannot pass legislation without Democratic votes. (In the case of a 50-50 tie, the vice president casts the tie breaker -- presumably in favor of the GOP side.) While only one Republican -- Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul -- has thus far signaled he might vote no on the Obamacare repeal mechanism currently moving through the Senate, potential flashpoints have already emerged that could jeopardize further votes. House Speaker Paul Ryan's support of using the Obamacare repeal measure to strip federal funding for Planned Parenthood, an organization that provides abortions as part of its broader reproductive health care services to men and women, could cost the GOP two key votes. That measure would likely pass in the House, but two pro-abortion rights GOP senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, won't commit to approving the bill with the Planned Parenthood provision in it. "I'm going to wait and see what happens," Collins told reporters on Thursday, indicating she thinks it's too early to decide how she will vote on the bill. "Obviously, I'm not happy to hear the speaker wants to include defunding of Planned Parenthood, an extremely controversial issue in the package." Murkowski has said this week she won't "speculate" about how she may vote on a hypothetical repeal package. When asked her position Thursday, Murkowski's spokeswoman Karina Petersen said the senator "is concerned about defunding Planned Parenthood as she is a longtime support of Planned Parenthood and has opposed broadly defunding the organization." Paul has already voted against moving forward on the measure, which repeals Obamacare through a procedure called budget reconciliation. By voting on Obamacare through the budget process, the Senate can clear the measure with a simply majority -- meaning they theoretically need no Democratic votes to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The libertarian-leaning Kentucky Republican has spoken out against the measure, however, because he says it would increase deficit spending and doesn't balance the budget. He's already trying to rally his colleagues and members of the budget hawkish House Freedom Caucus to join him, though he hasn't found any takers yet. Instead, Paul wants to replace Obamacare on the same day Republicans repeal the law. He The GOP may face a further internal debate over the "replace" piece of the puzzle. While many Republicans support using budget reconciliation to repeal Obamacare, which is possible due to the tax and revenue-related elements of Obamacare, they cannot use the tactic to replace the bill. Many Republicans have favored a plan to repeal the bill early in the Trump administration and then take time to come up with a plan to replace it. On Thursday, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn said that he would be against a "comprehensive" bill, and would support instead smaller measures to replace it. But Paul has been joined by Sen. Tom Cotton, of Arkansas in supporting a repeal with an immediate replacement. "I think when we repeal Obamacare we need to have the solution in place moving forward," the Arkansas Republican told MSNBC's Chuck Todd Thursday. "I don't think we can just repeal Obamacare and say we're going to get the answer two years from now. This is a very complicated problem." Trump himself has also spoken in favor of immediate replacement -- though it's unclear if he was referring to when the replacement would take effect or when it should be passed. As insurance providers have already set their policies for the coming year, the repeal would not affect Americans this year regardless of when it was passed. "No, we're going to do it simultaneously. It'll be just fine," Trump told CBS' "60 Minutes" in November when asked if there would be any gap in coverage. "We're not going to have, like, a two-day period and we're not going to have a two-year period where there's nothing. It will be repealed and replaced." "No, we're going to do it simultaneously.

It will be repealed and replaced." ©The Senate's razor-thin balance of power -- 52 Republicans and 48 Democrats -- means that just a few senators can tip the scale on whether a bill passes -- and some lawmakers are already embracing their potential influence. As the GOP looks to take advantage of having Republican President-elect Donald Trump in the White House, party leaders have promised an ambitious first 100 days agenda. But to do so, they'll need to keep everyone in their party happy. And senators on both sides are quick to realize they can gain leverage if a vote will come down to party lines. That provides opportunities for senators with pet issues to draw lines in the sand, for vulnerable senators up for re-election to get airtime, and for moderates on both sides to work across the aisle on compromise bills. Some examples have already emerged. Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul voted against the motion to open up Obamacare repeal proceedings on Wednesday do to opposition to the underlying budget. Though Republicans still had the votes to proceed, Paul is lobbying his colleagues and working with members of the House to try to force his colleagues to oppose deficit spending, even if it jeopardizes Republicans' pledged Obamacare repeal. Paul met Thursday morning with the House Freedom Caucus, a group of roughly 40 Republicans in the House who have caused headaches far bigger than their small numbers for Republican leadership. Paul left the meeting without firm commitments, though the group plans to continue to meet on it. While on his way to make a similar pitch to his Senate colleagues, Paul said in response to a question that the Freedom Caucus could serve as a model for a small percentage of the GOP caucus having a big impact in the Senate, too. "We're going to try. We'll see," Paul said. Another Obamacare issue is the fate of efforts to defund Planned Parenthood, which is opposed by most Democrats. Two pro-abortion rights senators, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, won't commit to approving the bill with the Planned Parenthood provision in it, endangering GOP hopes of easily getting the Affordable Care Act repeal legislation through the Senate. Other senators are also flexing their muscles on key issues. As Trump continues to deny and downplay Russia's role in hacking Democratic political groups in an effort to influence the election, as determined by the US intelligence community and third-party experts, Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham have been vocal in their condemnation of Russia's interference. McCain and Graham are working with Democrats, including Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin, on legislation that would impose sanctions on Russia beyond those announced by the White House last month, which would force Trump to accept the sanctions or publicly revoke them. McCain and Graham both emphasized that their work on Russia wasn't out of the mainstream. "I think there's a supermajority for what I'm talking about," Graham said when asked about how much influence a few senators could have. But McCain acknowledged that the narrow Senate majority gives heft to a small voting bloc. "That makes it more impactful," he acknowledged, while also emphasizing the bipartisan nature of the effort. The narrow majority has also allowed Republicans to hold sway over Trump's nominees. When Trump nominated Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson as secretary of state, McCain and Graham joined Sen. Marco Rubio in expressing concerns and questions about Tillerson's friendly relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, with whom Tillerson has interacted for his business interests in Russia. McCain has said since meeting with Tillerson some of his concerns have been answered and Rubio said Thursday he will meet with Tillerson early next week, but the nominee is sure to face tough questioning on the issue during his confirmation hearings on Wednesday. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which will hear Tillerson's nomination, is one of the committees that only have a one-vote majority for Republicans this Congress -- meaning any unsatisfied Republican could vote against advancing a nominee to the floor and make the nominee's path more difficult. Membership on that committee includes Rubio; Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, who is up for re-election this year, has sparred with Trump in the past and is likely to be targeted by Democrats; and Paul, whose foreign policy views tend to be more isolationist than his party's and who is against nation-building. Rubio demurred when asked if he and his colleagues could seek to increase their influence by forming a bloc, as did Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz. The two close friends, along with fellow good friend Utah Sen. Mike Lee and blue-state Republican Nevada Sen. Dean Heller, have already teamed up on legislative advocacy in the first three days of this Congress. "I'm not sure anyone around here's thinking in those terms," Rubio said. "By and large, we worked real hard to have a majority so we can undo a lot of the damage that's been done to this country over the last few years. So I've never heard or think there's any effort ongoing to create some sort of bloc to steer policy and create some sort of leverage." Still, if three members voted in concert, they could prove a make-or-break bloc on legislation. And Cruz and Lee have not shied away from taking on members of their own party in the past. And it's not just Republicans who could take advantage of the narrow majority. On Thursday, 13 Democrats put out a statement appealing to Republican leadership on Obamacare, billing themselves as "moderate Democrats" open to working across the aisle, including Democrats such as North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp and Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill, who are up for re-election in red states in 2018. West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat in a red state also up for re-election next term, has also been looking to reach across the aisle, skipping a meeting with President Barack Obama and Democrats on the Hill this week in favor of talking to both sides. Manchin said he hopes Republicans also understand the importance of working with a few members of the other side, citing how many Democrats it will take them to overcome the 60-vote filibuster threshold. "They understand, it's going to take eight. If they can hold all the Republicans at 52, then it will take eight of us to get anything moving," Manchin said. "So you're going to have to be working with 10, 12, truly sitting down with 10 or 12 moderate Democrats as you think that you want to move things forward." "They understand, it's going to take eight. If they can hold all the Republicans at 52, then it will take eight of us to get anything moving," Manchin said. "So you're going to have to be working with 10, 12, truly sitting down with 10 or 12 moderate Democrats as you think that you want to move things forward." ©The Supreme Court wars escalated this week when Democrats signaled they are ready to fight for the seat they believe should have gone to Merrick Garland, and already the prospect of the nuclear option is being discussed. "Let's see who they nominate," Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Wednesday to reporters. "If they're in the mainstream we'll give them a very careful look. If they're out of the mainstream we'll oppose them tooth and nail." And asked the night before by MSNBC's Rachel Maddow if he would consider trying to keep the seat vacant -- leaving the court with only eight justices -- Schumer said, "Absolutely." "We are not going to make it easy for them to pick a Supreme Court justice," he said. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell responded immediately. "The American people simply will not tolerate" Democrats blocking a Supreme Court nominee, he told reporters. It is unclear when President-elect Donald Trump will nominate someone to fill the vacant seat on the bench. Ratcheting up the debate could impact the type of person Trump selects. He has a list of 21 potential choices unveiled last year meant to appeal to conservatives. He has options. He could look for alternatives not on the list, dig deep on the list to find someone who might garner less controversy, or go big by naming Judge William Pryor - a conservative favorite who also has attracted the most opposition from liberals. Others on the list include Judge Diane Sykes of the 7th Court of Appeals, Judge Thomas Hardiman from the 3rd Circuit and Judge Steve Colloton from the 8th Circuit. A Pryor nomination would be considered the least "mainstream" name on the list for liberals and could possibly force Republicans to push for a rules change and do away with the filibuster that is in place for the Supreme Court seat. Changing the rules is a delicate subject. Old Guard Republicans might push back. In 2013 when then Majority leader Harry Reid led the charge to get rid of the filibuster for lower court nominees, Sen. John McCain took to the floor. "We are approaching a slippery slope that will destroy the very unique aspect of this institution called the US Senate," he said. Of course it was Democrats who opened the door to a rules change when they got rid of the filibuster for the lower courts, something Schumer says he regrets. "Wish it hadn't happened," Schumer told CNN's Dana Bash this week. The argument could be made that Republicans would never have taken that first step. Secondly, there is a good chance that Trump will have more than one chance to name a Supreme Court Justice given that three justices are in their late 70's and early 80's. That seat could be the big fight as it would most likely move the court further to the conservative side. The argument: since that seat might prompt a rules change why not do it now? Richard Arenberg, a former staff member for three Democratic senators and co-author "Defending the Filibuster: The Soul of the Senate" wrote this week in the New York Times that the Republicans shouldn't weaken the filibuster. "The Senate has historically been the one place in our government where legislative minorities are protected, with rules to check overzealous majorities," Arenberg wrote. He said Republicans have other options such as using public opinion to force votes, requiring debate around the clock and focusing on endangered Democratic senators who must run for re-election in 2018 in states that Trump won. The irony of the debate is not lost on anyone. After Schumer suggested he might work to hold the seat open, conservative And when McConnell said that the American people would not allow the seat to remain open Jason Steed, an appellate lawyer, The Heritage Foundation's John Malcolm has praised Trump's list of 21 and sees a big difference now that the election is over. After Justice Antonin Scalia's death, McConnell said the seat should not be filled so close to the election so that the American people could choose. Malcolm "The voters, however, rejected this vision of where the court ought to go," Malcolm told the Daily Signal. Elizabeth Wydra of the progressive Constitutional Accountability Center sees things differently. "Given that most Americans support Roe v Wade, oppose flooding the political system with special interest cash, and believe in the values of equality and inclusion expressed in the Constitution, there is no reason to think they would support a Supreme Court nominee who would promote an extreme conservative agenda from the bench," she said.

It was 1994 and the land once known as "Trump City" was an embarrassing boondoggle, crumbling at the feet of an erratic namesake who took out $400 million in loans and seemed all too willing to default on more. Chase realtors could not see a path to black for debt king Donald Trump. Tom Barrack could. "We're going to really, really attack Donald on this and take him down -- or you can help us," one Chase honcho told Barrack, a Los Angeles-based real estate titan with no ties -- beyond friendship -- to the deal. "You're the person who could solve it." Over the next seven days before Christmas, Barrack and his lieutenant, Bill Rogers, would jet from New York to Los Angeles, Taiwan, London and Saudi Arabia, begging billionaires to buy the loans and keep the bankers from Trump's throat. "He nearly killed me that week," Rogers says now, recounting the frenzied middle-of-the-night flights that kept the $4.5 billion West Side Railyards site from being Trump's burial ground. "There's one person in this world who has historically had a non-fighting way of working with Donald -- and being successful." Two decades later, that lifesaver is playing his most prominent role yet. Barrack is overseeing Trump's inauguration in two weeks -- a project that has so far raised close to $90 million. Once the festivities are over, Barrack, 69, is poised to wield enormous influence in Trump's Washington as the person perhaps closest to the new president outside of his immediate family. Over the next four years, a dozen people close to Barrack and Trump observed in interviews, Barrack is almost certain to reprise the middleman job he played during that West Side crisis -- as an inimitable powerbroker to the set of elites desperate to control him, and as a calming guardrail to the man who doesn't want to be controlled. "Most of the people around him are all vying for his attention, his acknowledgment or his approval," Barrack said during an interview this week at Washington's new Trump International Hotel, where he is recognized by name by staff and well-wishers who interrupt him with meeting or favor requests for Trump's team. That's his life these days: "It's like being the concierge or the sommelier of choice." With the 6-foot-2 build of a shooting guard and the aphorisms of an inspirational speaker, Barrack admits he is not the likeliest Trump surrogate. With his refined, almost patrician image and the sensibilities of a Renaissance Man, the Arabic-speaking Barrack cuts a striking visage in the populist orbit that is ushering Trump to the White House. But friends and rivals alike note that Barrack, with a net worth of $1 billion and a network that includes Qatari princes and France's Nicolas Sarkozy, offers something that so few of the people battling for Trump's ear today can match: trust that, as his financial peer, he looks out for no one but Trump. It is a friendship forged in both the tumble of deals gone awry and the triumph of a shocking political upset. At every turn over the last two years, when Trump found himself against the world, Barrack on the other end of the line, dispensing frank truths while pleading to the offended that Trump meant no harm. When scores of women emerged to allege sexual misconduct by Trump this past October, Barrack asked him to write down what exactly made him upset in private, and at the same time promised to vouch for his integrity in public. When in need of a way to soften his image with Mexico, Barrack encouraged Trump to take a last-minute secret trip to Mexico and show he could blunt his rhetoric on the world stage. And when Muslim monarchs rang alarm bells at a policy meant to forbid their 1.6 billion adherents from immigrating to the US, Barrack urged Trump to retool his abrasive posture -- while back-channeling soothing words to his own Rolodex. By now, word of his influence has gotten around: Barrack serves as the connective fiber between his elite circles and the insular, Breitbart-infused Trump Tower. He brokered a meeting on climate change between Leonardo DiCaprio and the President-elect, and fields phone calls and emails from worried investors and ambassadors seeking reassurances from the next leader of the free world: "Tell me we're going to be OK," they implore Barrack. In a city full of lobbyists eager to play connector, it is the cabal of longtime Trump associates -- from Barrack to Roger Stone to Carl Icahn -- who are the new set of Washington greasers. "The way it used to be, you go to a lobbyist, you pay the lobbyist a bunch of money, and he takes care of politics," said Gary Winnick, a close friend to Trump and Barrack who now spends much of his time making similar introductions. But Trump campaigned vigorously against the lobbyist culture, and would care for something different, Winnick stressed. "Tom was there when Donald was getting his a-- kicked in the 80s and 90s," he said. "I don't think Donald has ever forgotten that." Born to immigrants who owned a tiny Lebanese grocery store, Barrack made his fortune in distressed assets, or what he saw as low-risk, high-reward properties desperate for rehabilitation. He and Trump argued, bartered and caroused together. Barrack now fondly remembers deals where Trump "took me to the cleaners." And over time, the two indulged in elements of celebritydom: Trump as a fixture of the New York socialite scene; Barrack as an investor in Hollywood film companies and as a Mr. Fix It for distressed celebrities -- he is credited with saving Michael Jackson's Neverland Ranch, and counts Rob Lowe as one of his best friends. But it was in the 1990s when Trump grew attached to Barrack, born just a year after him and with the emotional composure that even Trump's allies say he lacks. Over the years, the two would share tales of their marital struggles, friends say, and bond over their moments as classic tough guys. "They used to like to arm wrestle together," cracked Doug Manchester, a longtime Barrack pal. "Not literally -- but maybe." The stories are ripped from movies: When two intimidating men barreled down Park Avenue one spring day after pick-pocketing a woman's purse, Rogers recalls, Barrack delivered a rugby tackle he learned in college and held one of them down for 20 minutes. Soon after, the other culprit's half-dozen friends socked him in the nose, spilling blood over his cream-colored suit. "He's a man. He falls off horses going full speed, surfs waves. He's a stud," Laird Hamilton, a well-known professional surfer in Hawaii who rides aggressive waves with Barrack, said from his boat in Hanalei Bay. "We like the feeling of challenging the impossible." Barrack, many of his associates recounted, offers an eclectic spin on the quintessential "guy's guy." He jeers friends when they appear out of shape at the gym, but has chosen competitive polo -- not Trump's golf game -- as his sport of choice. He drinks alcohol, but grows his own wine at a 1,300-acre ranch he built near Santa Barbara, California, and spends his summers lavishly near Cannes in the French Riviera. His aggression doesn't extend to politics. A moderate Republican, Barrack has little interest in partisan combat and said he was occasionally dispirited by Trump's most corrosive rhetoric. His extemporaneous prime-time speech at last summer's Republican National Convention -- most memorable for awkwardly deeming his speech preceding that of Trump's daughter to be the "anchovy on Ivanka's caesar salad" -- featured another surprising moment. He told the crowd of Republican activists, who had encouraged speakers all week to "lock her up," that he had nothing negative whatsoever to say about Hillary Clinton. "Donald used Tom at the beginning to bounce ideas off of him. Tom didn't get into it for political reasons," said Nick Ribis, a top Trump casino executive who later worked for Barrack. Ribis marvels at how the two personalities co-existed. "Egos tend to get in the way - jealousy and egos. It wasn't that way with Donald and Tom." Despite his total lack of political experience, Barrack volunteered to hold Trump's first major fundraiser at his home, raising $7 million in a show of force that attendees at the head table describe as an emotional moment for the old friends. Some associates recall having never once before heard Barrack discuss politics before that evening. The soft-spoken Barrack describes the campaign as his own personal metamorphosis. "This is where I come from. That's me," Barrack, now the head of a $60 billion company, Colony Capital, said he thought as he soaked in Trump crowds across the country. "This is more me than the me now." Barrack's adventure in cash-collecting was not without stumbles. Trump fundraisers say he dropped off the map after that event and for most of the campaign. And despite broadcasting widely that a super PAC he helped organize, Rebuilding America Now, had made a splash and took in $32 million this summer, that money was slow to materialize -- if it did at all. Barrack, over-extended and overwhelmed by looming campaign finance restrictions on what he'd be able to legally discuss with Trump, suddenly distanced himself from the group, which never lived up to its hype as Barrack watched Trump be massively outspent on television for nearly the entire race. Part of the trouble was that despite Barrack's place in the firmament of high society, sources said, he offered none of traditional fundraising relationships that Trump desperately needed. He knew nothing of the network assembled by Charles and David Koch, and though he scored a meeting with Las Vegas casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and his wife, he was unable to secure his confidence and a donation to his super PAC. The inauguration grants him something of a path to fundraising redemption. This time, Barrack won a $5 million check from the Adelsons, according to a person familiar with the donation. Barrack now talks to Trump every day about the ceremony, and it's that confidence of the President-elect that inauguration planners say gives him wide latitude over every last detail of the day, which will emphasize the military and "inclusiveness" rather than the traditional focus on celebrities. And for all Trump's fundraising struggles during the campaign, the inauguration is surprisingly well funded. The $90 million figure revealed to CNN came in large part from what Barrack called "a lot of low-hanging fruit" from Trump gadflies eager to make amends for their past stinginess. "Many of the establishment Republicans who were not involved in Trump Victory have now unified," said Elliott Broidy, one of the Trump campaign's most elite fundraisers and a vice chair of the Inaugural Committee. "That can be credited to Tom doing a phenomenal job articulating our President-elect's vision." He expects to keep at it well after the ceremony concludes. While Barrack has leaned into his role as Trump's filter to the outside world, he still dreams of an even bigger role. Perpetually sleepless and rarely in the same city for multiple nights, Barrack envisions himself making frequent trips to the Middle East on behalf of the administration's interests. He is already calling upon his far-flung network to help place US ambassadors in capitals overseas. But as Trump loyalists know, there is always the looming danger of overplaying your hand in Trump World. It's a lesson that Washington is soon to learn. "There's nobody bigger in Donald's eyes than Donald -- and don't try to compete with that," warns Winnick. "I'm not sure everybody else knows that, but Tom does." "There's nobody bigger in Donald's eyes than Donald -- and don't try to compete with that," warns Winnick. "I'm not sure everybody else knows that, but Tom does." ©To close out the first work week of 2017, GOP hand wringing and another POTUS exit interview lead the way. Two more Republican senators in the last 24 hours are sounding the alarm that repealing Obamacare without a replacement plan in place may not be good for the health of the GOP ... much less the country. But will it stop them from voting for a repeal? That may be a step too far. Meanwhile, President Barack Obama says he's ready to give Republicans credit and offer his full support if his political rivals prescribe a better health care program. New Republican Study Committee Chairman, Mark Walker (R-NC), told According to the CBO, tax breaks ©President-elect Donald Trump downplayed Russia's role in the election after a briefing with top US intelligence officials, even as a declassified report of their conclusions pointed definitively at Vladimir Putin. "While Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations, including the Democrat National Committee, there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election, including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines," Trump said in a statement after the meeting. Trump also tried to defuse controversy over his criticism of the intelligence community and continued refusal to accept Moscow's actions, calling the Friday meeting "constructive" and offering praise for the senior intel officials. He said he will appoint a team within 90 days to figure out ways to stop foreign hacking. The United States' most senior intelligence officials briefed Trump on Russian hacking during the election campaign just hours after the President-elect doubled down on his dismissal of the threat as an artificial and politically driven controversy, calling it a "witch hunt." Trump's meeting with the intel officials took around 90 minutes at Trump Tower. A Trump spokeswoman said the officials who gave the briefing were Director of National A senior transition official described the meeting between Trump and intelligence community officials as "cordial," not contentious. Trump asked questions and made clear his admiration for intelligence community employees, the official added. Based on the presentation Friday, which included new information, the official insisted that it's the transition's view that the hacking was intended to harm Hillary Clinton more than to help Trump. This official pointed to what they were told at the meeting, that the cyberactivity began in late 2015 and early 2016, before it was clear Trump would be the nominee. So, the official asked, how could the hacking be a pro-Trump operation if it began so early on. "This was more an effort to discredit her than anything else," the official said. The official would not weigh in on the intelligence community's main conclusion that Putin directed the hacking operation, saying it was based on classified information. In a statement Friday accompanying the release of a declassified report on Russian involvement, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence It added that the Department of Homeland Security concluded that "the types of systems the Russian actors targeted or compromised were not involved in vote tallying." Trump's public refusal to acknowledge the intelligence community's conclusions drew sharp responses from Democratic lawmakers Friday. And with the release of the report, Democrats said they will renew their push for a bipartisan independent commission to investigate Russia's actions. To date, Republicans have insisted on keeping investigations within existing committees that they control. "There must be a bipartisan, independent, outside commission to understand how Russia hacked into our democratic institutions, and to ensure it never happens again," said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat. "Vladimir Putin's assault on American democracy was political thuggery in support of Donald Trump, and there must be consequences." Pelosi, who had earlier called the report's conclusions "stunning," said she is co-sponsoring House legislation that was re-introduced Friday and calls for a bipartisan, independent commission. California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, formerly a longstanding member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said she and other senators will soon introduce a similar bill. "This issue must not be politicized -- all Americans should be outraged at Russia's actions, and we must hold them accountable," she said. Senate Minority Leader and New York Democrat Charles Schumer said, "That any foreign power could influence an American election should send shivers down the spines of both political parties, regardless of which party benefited this time around ... We need to confront this interference head on, in an aggressive and bipartisan manner. If we don't, it'll be open season for any foreign power who wants to cause trouble in our elections." Rep. Adam Schiff, the California Democrat and ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, dismissed Trump's argument out of hand. "The President-Elect's statement that the Russian hacking had 'absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election' is not supported by the briefing, report, or common sense," Schiff said in a statement. He added that while there was no tampering with vote tallying, "it is anotherxc2xa0thing to say that the daily dumping of documents disparaging to Secretary Clinton that was made possible by Russian cyberoperations had no effect on the campaigns." Schiff said the Putin-directed effort was "hugely beneficial to the President-Elect and damaging to the Clinton campaign, just as the Russians intended," and called on Trump to act "appropriately in the face of this clear-cut, Russian malicious activity against America.xc2xa0That starts by accepting the facts.xc2xa0The President-Elect must not obfuscate or distract, but deal honestly with the truth of what happened." One Republican, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, took the opportunity to pressure Trump to get tougher on Moscow. "I take his statement as an encouraging sign that he wants to push back against those who engaged in cyberattacks against our country's national security, economic and political interests," Graham said in a statement.xc2xa0 "More specifically, when it comes to Russia, I look forward to working with President-elect Trump to achieve those goals," added Graham, who is pushing to sanction Russia for its activities in cyberspace, Syria and against US allies in Europe.xc2xa0"Now is the time to throw rocks, not pebbles, and a good place for us to start would be to institute additional punishments on Russia for their cyber interference in the 2016 elections." Shortly after Trump's statement, the intelligence community released a declassified version of the report that found Putin had ordered a campaign to influence the 2016 election with the goal of denigrating Clinton, boosting Trump and undermining public faith in the democratic process. "We further assess Putin and the Russian government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump," the intelligence report said. The Russian efforts blended covert activity, including cyber operations, with overt efforts, including paying social media "trolls." The operation was just "the most recent expression of Moscow's longstanding desire to undermine the US-led liberal order," the report said. The report shared conclusions reached in the classified version, but didn't include information that could give away sources and collection methods. Despite the fact that the intelligence community has never argued that the hacks swayed the outcome of the election, Trump and other Republicans have continued to emphasize that point. Intelligence leaders have been careful to stress that voting systems weren't tampered with, but they told a Senate hearing Thursday that it was impossible to assess how the hacking may have affected voters' attitudes. After lawmakers and intelligence officials expressed concern at that hearing about Trump's putdowns "I have tremendous respect for the work and service done by the men and women of this community to our great nation," Trump said. Former CIA chief and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta called those comments a step in the right direction for Trump. "I pray that we get beyond this bickering and tweeting with regards to the intelligence community," he said on CNN's "The Situation Room." "And his statement today at least was a step in the right direction. He talked about having a constructive meeting, he indicated he has tremendous respect for the men and women in our intelligence community ... so I hope that he's moving in the right direction." President Barack Obama, who last month asked the intelligence community to provide the comprehensive report on Russia's cyberactivities last month, was briefed Thursday. Trump's muted reaction to the officials' briefing will not subdue questions about his stance on Russia. Trump has repeatedly rejected the October assessment of all 17 US intelligence agencies that Russia stole and shared emails from Democratic organizations and individuals and probed voting systems in several states. Throughout the campaign, Trump emphasized his interest in improving relations with Moscow and his admiration for Putin, who he has praised as a strong leader who is "very smart." That praise has puzzled observers, who point to Russia's annexation of Crimea, its alliance with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, its attempts to destabilize US allies in Europe, particularly in the Baltic states, its harassment of US diplomats, and its systematic expulsion of American Non-Governmental Organizations in Russia. Trump has derided intelligence agencies for weeks, setting off the word "intelligence" in quotation marks to indicate his skepticism and suggesting their conclusions were politically motivated. That idea is anathema to officers who pride themselves on providing "unvarnished" and "untainted" information to policy makers, Clapper said. California Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell and Maryland Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings re-introduced a bill Friday to establish a bipartisan, 12-member commission that has the support of 170 House lawmakers. The legislation calls for the commission to examine Russia's hacking as well as cyber intrusions by other nations and produce a report with recommendations to the President within 18 months. Over 50,000 Americans have signed a petition released Friday urging Congress to create an independent commission, telling lawmakers that "regardless of whether you voted for Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, or anyone else, Russia's attacks on our election are an attempt to degrade our democracy." ©President-elect Donald Trump's transition team has told all ambassadors who are political appointees of President Barack Obama to vacate their overseas posts by Inauguration Day, refusing to provide even brief grace periods for special cases, several senior State Department officials and American diplomats said. "Political" ambassadors often have close ties to the president or are major donors and almost always leave their post at the end of the term, while career ambassadors frequently remain in their posts. In keeping with standard practices, the White House requested and received resignations from all politically-appointed chiefs of mission shortly after Election Day, several senior State Department officials told CNN. But, in a break with precedent to consider grace periods on a case-by-case basis, a subsequent State Department cable sent last month to all non-career ambassadors instructed them to finish their service by January 20 "without exceptions," the sources said. The move, first reported by The New York Times, leaves the US without top envoys at key posts such as Britain, Germany, Canada, Japan and Saudi Arabia until President-elect Donald Trump nominates successors and they are confirmed, a process that could take months. In the meantime, the posts will be run by the highest-ranking career official until Trump nominates, and the Senate confirms, someone new. The decision has also left diplomats scrambling to secure new visas, living arrangements and schools for their children, including Ambassador to Costa Rica Stafford Fitzgerald Haney, who diplomats say has four school-age children and a wife battling breast cancer. Mark Gilbert, the US ambassador to New Zealand told CNN he was denied a one-week extension after January 20 to finish packing his residence. Past incoming administrations from both parties have granted exceptions on a case-by-case basis for ambassadors requesting to remain at post for weeks or months. The exceptions are generally granted as a courtesy to ambassadors with school-age children or who have unique family situations, but are also occasionally made to help with continuity as the incoming administration seeks to fill a large number of postings at home and overseas. Secretary of State John Kerry told CNN's Wolf Blitzer that it is a "perfectly normal request" to political ambassadors to leave their post, noting that "all political appointees serve at the pleasure of the President of the United States." But Kerry added, "Some people ask for an extension for some reason or another. In some cases, it might make sense to think sensitively about that." In 2009, Obama granted several exceptions to Bush-era political ambassadors for work or personal reasons. The State Department estimates that roughly 70% of US ambassadors are career appointees. Those ambassadors were not asked to tender resignation letters. The State Department estimates that roughly 70% of US ambassadors are career appointees. Those ambassadors were not asked to tender resignation letters. ©Several of President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet nominees have still not been properly vetted less than one week before hearings begin on Capitol Hill, the Office of Government Ethics said in a letter to Democratic senators Friday. "The announced hearing schedule for several nominees who have not completed the ethics review process is of great concern to me," wrote Walter M. Shaub, director of the Office of Government Ethics, in a letter to New York Sen. Chuck Schumer and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. "This schedule has created undue pressure on OGE's staff and agency ethics officials to rush through these important reviews." Shaub, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, said his office hasn't received initial drafts from some nominees. "I am not aware of any occasion in the four decades since OGE was established when the Senate held a confirmation hearing before the nominee had completed the ethics review process," he said. However in 2001, the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee held a confirmation hearing on Education Secretary Rod Paige eight days before receiving his OGE paperwork. The nominees in question, according to a Senate Democratic source, are Trump's pick to lead Department of Homeland Security, John Kelly; Education Secretary-designate Betsy DeVos; Commerce Secretary-designate Wilbur Ross; and Ben Carson, whom Trump has tapped to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Nominees who are appointed by the President to positions that require Senate confirmation have to obtain OGE's certification of their financial disclosure reports. And nominees must also "make current" their financial disclosure reports by the date of the hearing, added Shaub, who said it would be "cause for alarm" if the Senate proceeded with hearings before OGE has certified nominees' reports. The letter was released by Schumer's office, and the Senate Democratic leader blasted Trump's transition team and Senate Republicans over the matter. "The Office of Government Ethics letter makes crystal clear that the transition team's collusion with Senate Republicans to jam through these cabinet nominees before they've been thoroughly vetted is unprecedented," Schumer said. "The Senate and the American people deserve to know that these cabinet nominees have a plan to avoid any conflicts of interest, that they're working on behalf of the American people and not their own bottom line, and that they plan to fully comply with the law. Senate Republicans should heed the advice of this independent office and stop trying to jam through unvetted nominees."xe2x80x8b Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's office declined to comment Saturday. The Trump transition team responded Saturday, saying all of the nominees are qualified and expressing disappointment in the push back from Democrats. "President-elect Trump is putting together the most qualified administration in history and the transition process is currently running smoothly. In the midst of a historic election where Americans voted to drain the swamp, it is disappointing some have chosen to politicize the process in order to distract from important issues facing our country. This is a disservice to the country and is exactly why voters chose Donald J. Trump as their next president."

Trump as their next president." ©President-elect Donald Trump is continuing to resist conclusions reached by US intelligence agencies on Russian involvement in the 2016 election, and on Saturday defended his long-held belief that closer ties with Russia would be good for the US. Trump's comments come one day after he received intelligence stating that the Russian government "Having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing. Only 'stupid' people, or fools, would think that it is bad, We have enough problems around the world without yet another one. When I am President, Russia will respect us far more than they do now and both countries will, perhaps, work together to solve some of the many great and pressing problems and issues of the WORLD!" Trump tweeted. The US intelligence community concluded in a report publicly released Friday that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an "influence campaign" to harm Clinton's chances of being elected president. The campaign consisted of hacking Democrats, including Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, before releasing that information via third-party websites, including WikiLeaks. The intelligence report cited "a significant escalation" in longtime Russian efforts to undermine the American democratic process. Trump, however, has insisted Russia did not have an impact on the election results. Earlier Saturday, Trump tweeted, "Intelligence stated very strongly there was absolutely no evidence that hacking affected the election results. Voting machines not touched." Trump said Democrats are focusing on the hacking so intensely out of embarrassment. "Gross negligence by the Democratic National Committee allowed hacking to take place. The Republican National Committee had strong defense," he tweeted Friday night. "Only reason the hacking of the poorly defended DNC is discussed is that the loss by the Dems was so big that they are totally embarrassed," Trump added on Twitter. However, the intelligence noted multiple avenues in which Russia attempted to make sure Clinton lost. And the US intelligence community released several new pieces of information to support its conclusions Friday. "Moscow's influence campaign followed a Russian messaging strategy that blends covert intelligence operations -- such as cyberactivity -- with overt efforts by Russian government agencies, state-funded media, third-party intermediaries and paid social media users or 'trolls,' " the report found. Trump has repeatedly said that he wants to soften the harsh relationship between the US and Russia and has repeatedly praised Putin's leadership style. On the campaign trail, Trump would often ask "wouldn't it be great" if the US and Russia "got along."

On the campaign trail, Trump would often ask "wouldn't it be great" if the US and Russia "got along." ©Now that he's about to assume office, the real costs of the But Trump's grand vision of a impenetrable barrier from the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico -- a physical monument to his hardline immigration policy -- hasn't dimmed, although some of the specifics have changed. He is asking congressional Republicans, not Mexico, to fund the plan with taxpayer money through the appropriation process. As for his pledge to have Mexico foot the bill, Trump in a tweet Friday morning claimed "that any money spent on building the Great Wall (for sake of speed)" will be reimbursed down the line. Trump rarely shies away from superlatives and yet, his mention of a "Great Wall" invoked images of another very lengthy, defensive superstructure -- one he's had on his mind for a while. "You know, the Great Wall of China, built a long time ago, is 13,000 miles," Trump said in 2015. "I mean, you're talking about big stuff. We're talking about peanuts, by comparison, to that." But the differences don't end there. Here's how the President-elect's would-be border fortress stacks up against its Chinese competition. As Trump noted -- accurately -- the Great Wall of China runs more than 13,000 miles. According to a recent survey by China's State Administration of Cultural Heritage, it spans 15 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities. The US border with Mexico, meanwhile, touches only four states -- California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. There are currently 700 miles of fence along that track, with another approximately 1,200 miles either open, nearly impossible to actually build on or impassable. In China, different dynasties employed varying methods of construction. But the process was uniformly dangerous and unknown thousands of builders died in accidents and from overwork and exhaustion. Soldiers were employed at the very start, but over the centuries, criminals and conscripts did much of the work. Trump has not made clear who will handle construction now, though a number of private contractors, including the firm that If Trump can appropriate the funds he needs to start up construction again, the US project will have spanned parts of three presidential administrations. The Chinese process went on much longer, with dozens of rulers overseeing long periods of construction, followed by centuries of quiet, decay and, with the onset of a new dynasty, revamped efforts to repair and expand the great wall. China did get a bit of a head start. The American border barrier, mostly fence, was approved by Congress and The Chinese spent centuries using the wall as a means of defending their land and culture from nomadic tribes, Mongol raiders and other political enemies. During the rule of the Mongol Yuan Dynasty, at first led by Genghis Khan in the early 13th century, the wall was mostly used as a trading outpost and to help the ruling government put down rebellions. In the US, the political movement behind Trump's "build the wall" pitch is mostly concerned with illegal immigration -- even as the number of unauthorized Mexican migrants In the US, the political movement behind Trump's "build the wall" pitch is mostly concerned with illegal immigration -- even as the number of unauthorized Mexican migrants ©The US intelligence community concluded that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an "influence campaign" to harm Hillary Clinton's chances of winning the 2016 election. The declassified reported, released Friday, determined with "high confidence" that Russia's interference -- consisting of hacking Democratic groups and individuals and releasing that information via third-party websites, including WikiLeaks -- helped President-elect Donald Trump win the election. Here are some of the highlights from the report. "We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election. Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump." "We assess that influence campaigns are approved at the highest levels of the Russian government - particularly those that would be politically sensitive." "Putin most likely wanted to discredit Secretary Clinton because he has publicly blamed her since 2011 for inciting mass protests against his regime in late 2011 and early 2012, and because he holds a grudge for comments he almost certainly saw as disparaging him." "Russian efforts to influence the 2016 US presidential election represent the most recent expression of Moscow's longstanding desire to undermine the US-led liberal democratic order, but these activities demonstrated a significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and scope of effort compared to previous operations." "Moscow's influence campaign followed a Russian messaging strategy that blends covert intelligence operations -- such as cyberactivity -- with overt efforts by Russian government agencies, state-funded media, third-party intermediaries and paid social media users or 'trolls.'" "Before the election, Russian diplomats had publicly denounced the US electoral process and were prepared to publicly call into question the validity of the results. ProKremlin bloggers had prepared a Twitter campaign, #DemocracyRIP, on election night in anticipation of Secretary Clinton's victory, judging from their social media activity." "Russian media hailed President-elect Trump's victory as a vindication of Putin's advocacy of global populist movements - the theme of Putin's annual conference for Western academics in October 2016 -- and the latest example of Western liberalism's collapse." "Moscow will apply lessons learned from its Putin-ordered campaign aimed at the US presidential election to future influence efforts worldwide, including against US allies and their election processes." "We assess Russian intelligence services will continue to develop capabilities to provide Putin with options to use against the United States, judging from past practice and current efforts. Immediately after Election Day, we assess Russian intelligence began a spearphishing campaign targeting US government employees and individuals associated with US think tanks and NGOs in national security, defense, and foreign policy fields." "In early September, Putin said publicly it was important the DNC data was exposed to Wikileaks, calling the search for the source of the leaks a distraction and denying Russian 'state-level' involvement."

Jeff Sessions is preparing for yet another confirmation hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee. But this time, he'll be sitting in the witness chair. Instead of grilling a potential nominee, Sessions himself will be the main course as he faces his former colleagues Tuesday. A source familiar with his preparation says Sessions has been working hard since before Christmas on intense prep sessions and while he has spent time this week meeting with senators, he had a so-called "murder board" or mock hearing practice on Friday. Lawyers who have worked in the past for the Judiciary Committee are helping him get ready. Democratic senators are likely to ask him about a broad range of civil rights and civil liberties issues. Under President Barack Obama, the Department of Justice put an emphasis on issues such as voting rights, LGBT rights and criminal justice reform. If Sessions were to be confirmed as attorney general, he would likely shift Department resources to issues that came up during the campaign, including tougher immigration and drug enforcement. Confirmation hearings are a rite of passage for potential nominees. They can become a blistering showdown with vigorous back and forth that can be the death knell of a nominee. Other times, they feature searching questions and light hearted moments. Every once in a while, they are snoozers. This will not be a snoozer. Sessions served for years on the Senate Judiciary Committee. But in 1986, he appeared before the committee himself hoping to get confirmed for a federal judgeship. The hearing did not go well after allegations of racism surfaced. In an interview with CNN's Dana Bash in 2009, Sessions called the experience "heartbreaking" and added, "it was not a pleasant event, I gotta tell you." "Charges were thrown out and then you'd try to respond and it just wasn't able to get the message out. So it was a tough time, it ended up with a nine-to-nine final vote, so I was not moved out of the committee," The charges included allegations that Sessions may have called an African-American lawyer "boy" and had been critical of the NAACP and ACLU. Sessions told Bash the charges were "false" and "distortions." "I was caricatured in a way that was not me -- and my friends knew it," he said, adding that in the end, he came to peace. "I resolved that that would not affect me, that the rest of my life was not going to be focused on some event back then, and I would build a new life and go forward and do the right thing," a journey he said would be helped by the fact that he ended up serving on the Judiciary panel. On Tuesday, members of the NAACP protested his nomination by staging a sit-in in his Mobile office. The protesters were arrested but they managed to rally Sessions' critics. "Going into the hearings, we are worried that Republican senators are going to give Sen. Sessions a free pass simply because he's a fellow senator," said Christopher Kang, the national director of the National Council of Asian Pacific Americans. "The demonstrations in Alabama showed that people are watching and won't let that happen," Kang said. Sarah Isgur Flores, a spokeswoman for Sessions, said his critics are misrepresenting the senator. "Jeff Sessions has dedicated his career to upholding the rule of law, ensuring public safety and prosecuting government corruption," Flores said in a statement. "These false portrayals of Sen. Sessions will fail as tired, recycled, hyperbolic charges that have been thoroughly rebuked and discredited." This time around, Sessions will marshal not only his past experience as a nominee, but his time serving as senator in an attempt to explain to the American people what he'll do as President-elect Donald Trump's attorney general and why his critics are misrepresenting his record. He is armed with pages of testimony from friends and former colleagues. Former Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson -- no stranger to confirmation hearings -- issued a statement targeting Sessions' critics before the hearings. "He doesn't have a racist bone in his body. I've been an African-American man for 71 years. I think I know a racist when I see one. Jeff is far from being a racist. He's a good person, a decent person." Thompson said. Confirmation hearings haven't always been so newsworthy. But times, television and twitter have changed all that. David Ayres, who currently serves as CEO of The Ashcroft Group, helped to oversee numerous confirmation battles when he worked in government both helping to defeat nominees and get them confirmed. "It's Washington's bloodsport," he said in an interview. "It's like the gladiator going into the arena and the public watching." His advice? "Being calm, being human, turning the other cheek, is really something that people appreciate." Ayres often reminded nominees that the senators were coming in with their own agendas and causes and it helped to understand them. "They may have personal issues that they care about, and they are trying to set a tone for the administration, either positive or negative," he said. In the olden days, said Paul Collins, professor of legal studies at the University of Massachusetts, the hearings were more pro forma. "Nominees didn't really receive a lot of scrutiny from the Judiciary Committee," said Collins, the author of "Supreme Court Confirmation Hearings and Constitutional Change." "Rather, their confirmations tended to sail through the process without much difficulty." "The hearings were perfunctory, the senators gave the president the benefit of the doubt and the only the question was 'is he qualified,' " said Tom C. Korologos, who worked as a sherpa for nominees starting in the 70s. "Now, Congress has made them very ugly and politicized," he said. "They have become a political spectacle where the hearing isn't about the nominee -- it's about the members of the committee asking questions and making statements. The system has gone awry and it's a shame." Korologos remembers once when he looked a State Department employee in the eye and asked him if there was anything in his record that would embarrass the president. "I told him he could bank on being asked about it." He said the employee later withdrew because "I hit a nerve." Once, he said, he assisted the hearings for Nelson A. Rockefeller to be vice president. Rockefeller asked him whether his financial disclosure statement would be made public. Korologos was surprised when Rockefeller expressed concern about his image. Rockefeller said his friends and colleagues "are going to realize I'm not as rich as they think I am." Whether or not they serve as a proxy war between dueling parties, today there is an established system in place for the hearings. It starts with document submission. Sessions has submitted thousands of papers. When he failed to mention his previous hearings for the judgeship -- an omission seized upon by Democrats and opponents -- he immediately sent in supplements. In a letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley on December 23, Sessions said he had "located, recalled or been made aware of additional items" that were responsive. There is also the questionnaire. That's usually about 30 pages long. Finally, there is the hearing preparation. More often than not they include "murder boards." "In the murder board sessions, you try to beat up the nominees and ask the hardest thing you can ask," Ayres said. It gets them ready for the hearing, but it helps the nominee understand if they are having trouble in some area where they need to focus. "For the nominee, whether it's for a judicial position or Senate confirmation, those can be very humbling, humiliating experiences," he added. Sessions, who has undoubtedly reviewed the footage of his earlier hearings, will bring his experience to bear this time around. The hearings are deadly serious but offer the public a glimpse of the person behind the reputation. Justice Elena Kagan, during her confirmation hearings in 2010, misunderstood a question from Sen. Lindsay Graham. She thought he was asking her a legal question about an attempted terrorist attack that occurred on Christmas Day. She launched into a complicated answer when he stopped her. "I just asked you where you were at on Christmas," Graham said. Kagan paused. "You know, like all Jews, I was probably at a Chinese restaurant." The room erupted into laughter. She was confirmed.

She was confirmed. ©Michael Hayden, a former head of the CIA and National Security Agency, said Saturday that the newly-released intelligence report describing CNN's Michael Smerconish -- who expressed frustration that the presented evidence was heavily classified -- told Hayden the report left him "wanting more." Hayden said he "had the same sense of disappointment," though he "probably had a little more understanding as to why it was a brick short of a load." However, Hayden insisted, "an awful lot of the things we know can't be shared, because we need to keep going back to this well in the future, Michael, to learn things to keep America safe." Hayden also urged the American people to have faith in the US intelligence community, even if the details weren't clear. "When you've got the community coming together and giving 'high confidence' judgments to these things ... I certainly have confidence that that's a true story that was put out there, even though I haven't been able to see the fine print," he said. Hayden warned against a partisan reading of the report in light of Trump's attempts to "The criticism of the intelligence community's judgments on this issue has been that the community is incompetent and politicized and prejudiced and that's simply not right," Hayden said. The intelligence community, Hayden insisted, should be "above the partisan divide." "What we've seen since the election has been putting the intelligence community right smack in the middle of the middle lane of a hyperpartisan atmosphere here in Washington," he said. "Michael, intelligence can't survive in that lane. It will die."

In an exclusive interview with CNN -- his first since Trump's election -- Clancy also offered a wide-ranging look at the unique logistical challenges of providing security for the President-elect's large family and securing his New York residence. Most of all, however, he wanted to push back against suggestions that there were conflicts between the Secret Service and the private security team that's protected Trump for years. Politico "There is no friction at all" with Trump's private team, insisted Clancy, who said his agency has "sole responsibility" for protecting the President and the first family. He added that there is no overlap between the private team and his agency. "They are not in our meetings," Clancy said. "They are not armed. They are more of a staff function than a security function. We don't interact with them." He explained that while Trump's private team is there to ensure public events run smoothly and there are no disruptions from the crowd, Secret Service agents are the only ones protecting the President-elect. Although protesters have been a feature of many Trump campaign stops and some have pledged to protest the inauguration, Clancy said that unless a protester is a direct physical threat to the President, the Secret Service will not intervene. "We want to make sure everyone has their First Amendment rights," he said, adding that if a protester is removed, that is a decision made by event staff. Trump has named the head of his private security team, retired NYPD officer Keith Schiller, as his director of Oval Office operations and deputy assistant to the President. Clancy said Schiller serves as a "conduit for information" between the agents and the President-elect and helps inform the Secret Service about any changes to Trump's itinerary. "He has a larger family. He's got five children, grandchildren, so that will require more assets, more personnel," Clancy said. He noted that Trump's children are "young adults, so they're very active, they travel." But Trump's Fifth Avenue residence in New York City, Trump Tower -- where future First Lady Melania Trump plans to reside through next spring with the couple's youngest son -- presents a different challenge. It's not unusual for a first lady to be in a different location than the President, Clancy said, but he acknowledged the new Trump arrangement represents a "longer period of time" than usual -- even though his agency would never advise the first family to change their preferred living arrangements. "There are enough inconveniences when you take on this role as President and first lady," Clancy said. "We don't want to add to that." The midtown Manhattan building sits on one of the busiest streets in the country. Clancy said the goal is to provide robust security while simultaneously allowing local businesses and residents to continue using the building. "We are bringing in more resources" to handle the situation, he said, adding that the Secret Service is working to establish a command post inside Trump Tower that would be "pretty close to an entire floor." According to Jared Horowitz, who works for the company responsible for available commercial space at Trump Tower, the floors available to rent -- with the average floor space running between 13,500 to 15,500 square feet -- cost about $1.5 million a year. Asked about the high price tag, Clancy said they were required by law "to pay for the property that we need," adding that the space was "critical to the protection of the President, so it's something that needs to be done." "It's actually no different than what we've done with other presidents," Clancy continued. "We rented some property in Chicago when President Obama first became president for his trips when he was going out to Chicago. So, this is typically what we do." Regarding the government's negotiations with their new landlord, the Trump Organization, Clancy said, "They're very fair with us. They understand the responsibilities we have and they've been very accommodating." Clancy, a 27-year veteran of the Secret Service who ran the presidential protection division during the first years of Barack Obama's presidency, noted there are more similarities than differences among the presidents they protect. "I don't think any of them sleep very well," he said. "They're also very schedule-oriented. They all run on tight schedules," adding that, "They're all involved in athletics. Some enjoy golf, some enjoy running, some biking." In the past year and a half that the Secret Service has been working with Trump, Clancy said he has met with him a couple of times, describing him as "very gracious and very appreciative" of the Secret Service. Asked how Trump was adjusting to motorcades and having round-the-clock teams of armed agents guarding him, Clancy said "it's unusual for anyone to get used to it, but he has been terrific." Two newer areas the Secret Service is focused on are social media and cyberthreats, an area of particular concern given Trump's frequent use of Twitter and mounting concerns regarding US cybersecurity. The director said the Secret Service now has a specific division focused on potential social media threats. He also said they are deploying the same experts that provide cyber security for the US financial system in order to ensure that facilities visited by the president are defended from cyber-attacks. "Everything keeps me up night," he said of the array of threats. But, he added, "that's our business." But, he added, "that's our business." ©Take a look at the week in politics from January 1 through January 7. ©UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson arrived in the US Sunday for what his office said was a series of meetings with President-elect Donald Trump's closest advisers and congressional leaders. Johnson, a former mayor of London, became the principle diplomat for one of the US' strongest partners following the narrow success of 2016's referendum to leave the European Union, commonly referred to as Brexit. Johnson was among the referendum's highest profile supporters. Trump billed himself on Twitter as "Mr. Brexit" and likened his unlikely victory to the shocking success of the "yes" vote in the UK referendum. "Following the successful meeting last month between the prime minister's chiefs of staff and President-elect Donald Trump's team, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is undertaking a short visit to the US for meetings with close advisers to the President-elect and senior congressional leaders," a spokesman for Johnson's office said. "The discussions will be focused on UK-US relations and other foreign policy matters." Johnson, a member of the UK's Conservative Party, may find Trump's team more in line with his views and style than that of President Barack Obama. The foreign secretary's statements about the current administration made for After his victory in the presidential election, Trump took the unorthodox step of suggesting the pro-Brexit politician Nigel Farage be named the UK's envoy to the US. UK Prime Minister Theresa May Trump confirmed earlier this weekend that May, who ascended to the country's highest democratic office following the resignation of Prime Minister David Cameron in the wake of the Brexit vote, would visit him in the coming months. "I look very much forward to meeting Prime Minister Theresa May in Washington in the Spring. Britain, a longtime U.S. ally, is very special!"

"I looked at at my email, then I got the shock of my life," Brotman told CNN's Carol Costello. "I felt like Muhammad Ali had hit me in the stomach." Brotman, who has been the announcer at presidential inauguration for sixty years, said when he read the email from the Trump transition team he thought he "was going to commit suicide." He "I've been doing this for 60 years," he told the Washington ABC affiliate. In his place, the Trump team has tapped Steve Ray, a 58-year-old Washington-based freelance announcer who has worked with the MLB's Washington Nationals and for local radio stations.

"Since 1957, millions of Americans and countless entertainers have come to recognize Charlie Brotman as the voice of the inaugural parade," he said in a statement. "The Presidential Inaugural Committee will be proud to honor Charlie as Announcer Chairman Emeritus on January 20. We are thrilled for Steve Ray to be introducing a new generation of Americans to the grand traditions of the inaugural parade." Brotman told WJLA he wished Ray well.

"I think she's going to figure out ways to help kids and families. That's been what she's been focused on her whole life, and a lot of issues that are affecting them, over the next couple of years," Tanden told CNN's Jake Tapper on "State of the Union" Sunday. "But I don't expect her to ever run for any elected office again," she said. Tanden, a close Clinton ally and the head of the liberal think tank Center for American Progress, was shooting "I don't expect her to run for this and I don't expect her to run for other office," Tanden said. "I think her job is to -- what she's thinking about right now is how to help those kids and families as she has her whole life." If Clinton were to run -- and win -- it would put her on another collision course with President-Elect Donald Trump, who has been shaping his government from Fifth Avenue's Trump Tower. Clinton has largely remained out of the public eye since losing a bitterly fought campaign against the former reality star and businessman in the November vote. She has given few clues to what her next role will be, leaving a void in which speculation has run rife.

President-elect Trump's strategy on government inaction. And Team Trump's influence over state party organizations. It's all a part of this week's "Inside Politics" forecast, where you get tomorrow's headlines today. President Obama will bid the nation goodbye Tuesday night in his last big speech before yielding the spotlight to the Trump inauguration hoopla. You can be sure the President will offer another defense of his signature health care law and make the case that his administration put the economy back on solid footing after inheriting the 2008 financial crisis. The buzzy part, though, is likely to be what one Obama loyalist called a series of "admonitions about the challenges we face moving forward." Those admonitions will likely be squarely aimed at President-elect Donald Trump, and may include calls to celebrate America's diversity, to be more respectful of critics and, as the loyalist put it, "to strengthen and embrace our democracy." Every new president makes a splash on Inauguration Day with early executive orders and actions. We are told to expect Trump to stick with that tradition. But perhaps with an interesting twist. Abby Phillip of The Washington Post reports that in addition to telling agencies what he wants them to do, the new president is also considering telling some agencies to stand down, or be less active. On that list: the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is supposed to protect citizens from unscrupulous business practices. It was launched by Elizabeth Warren before she was elected to the US Senate from Massachusetts. "One big part of this could be ... a strategy that will allow him to have pretty widespread impact on the federal government immediately by simply telling people don't do anything, " explains Phillip. "And that's something that Republicans have wanted to do. It's sort of a slash and burn type of approach to federal governance and it's very different from what Washington has seen the last several years." Donald Trump has a long memory. Just ask Ohio Republicans. Gov. John Kasich never endorsed Trump, and now the President-elect is trying to exact revenge on a Kasich ally who is chairman of the state Republican Party. CNN's Jeff Zeleny says Ohio is just one state where Team Trump is trying to exert influence over state party organizations. "Donald Trump was personal, weighing in making telephone calls around the clock," says Zeleny. "It was part of a bloodbath, perhaps another installment of it with John Kasich. Donald Trump's people are watching the chairmanships across the country. A prime example, Ohio. And the Minnesota race is also open and a battle is brewing in Florida." Joe Manchin didn't get a job in Trump's Cabinet. But he is emerging as the President-elect's favorite Democrat on Capitol Hill. The West Virginia senator skipped the meeting with Obama when the President came to the Hill last week to talk health care, but then had a private meeting on the same issue with Vice President-elect Mike Pence. With Republicans having just a 52-48 Senate majority, Democratic votes for Trump initiatives will be vital. And CNN's Manu Raju says Manchin's calculation is that being close to Trump might annoy some of his Democratic colleagues in DC, but it will help with the voters back home. "I talked to Manchin ...he said he's open to working with the Trump team on a replacement plan for Obamacare, even though he opposes the repeal," Raju says. "That's much different from other Democrats. And, of course, their interests do align. Manchin is up for re-election in a very conservative state. Trump needs some Democratic support in the Senate to move his agenda. There are 10 Democratic senators who represent states that Trump overwhelmingly carried and five are very red states like West Virginia." Making college more affordable was a big theme in the Democratic presidential primaries last year, and one of the issues Hillary Clinton used to win the eventual support of rival Bernie Sanders. It remains a big priority for the Vermont senator and colleagues like Elizabeth Warren, and will be an issue when the President-elect's choice for education secretary, Betsy DeVos, gets her confirmation hearing. Jackie Kucinich of The Daily Beast explains the dynamics. "To what extent do the senators [Warren and Sanders] bring the issue back to the forefront?" she wonders.

"Back when Trump was spinning birther conspiracy theories, which were lapped up by gullible Republicans, one person who talked to Kushner says he offered assurances that his father-in-law didn't really believe that stuff," the report says. Kushner, a key adviser to Trump, is expected to play an influential role in the new administration and is reportedly taking steps toward preventing conflicts of interest from his own real estate business dealings. It's unclear whether he and wife Ivanka Trump will hold official positions, but Trump's team is confident that, at a minimum, the President-elect's daughter and son-in-law can act as informal advisers once he's in the White House. One sign they're serious: the Trump-Kushner family recently settled on a home in Washington, DC. The President-elect is expected to address his businesses and his family's participation in his presidency in a news conference this week. Ivanka Trump's husband was raised in New Jersey, the son of Charles Kushner, who found success in the residential real estate industry. The elder Kushner went to prison for nearly a year in the early 2000s for criminal tax evasion and witness tampering. Jared Kushner's father may have stoked his political interest at a young age - Charles Kushner was a prominent Democratic donor. When then-Vice President Al Gore attended a fundraiser at the family home, 19-year-old Jared introduced the candidate, one attendee told New York magazine. When his father-in-law announced his presidential bid, Kushner ultimately helped guide the candidate to victory, building a data operation with a tech startup-like feel that influenced the campaign's decisions from advertising to fundraising to voter targeting. In a December meeting of business leaders for the Partnership for New York City, Kushner told the crowd he will now take a managerial, not policymaking role, attendees told the magazine. Per the report, Kushner suggested the new administration would take a "rational" position on immigration. He predicted infrastructure investments from roads and bridges to driverless cars, Rice reported. As Kushner takes a victory lap and prepares for Washington life, his belief in Trump and his message hasn't faltered. "People say (Trump) is unhinged," Kushner told an associate, per the report. "I think he unhinged everyone else." "People say (Trump) is unhinged," Kushner told an associate, per the report.

Conway, Trump's campaign manager and soon-to-be senior White House adviser, acknowledged that "Russia, China and others" have attempted to hack American government and political groups, to CNN's Jake Tapper on "State of the Union." But she didn't directly criticize Russia at all, even after Trump received a briefing from top figures in the US intelligence community Friday laying out how Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a comprehensive cyber campaign against Democrat Hillary Clinton. Instead, she repeatedly turned the conversation to whether the Russian hacks of emails that were then published by WikiLeaks affected the outcome of the race -- and claimed they did not. "Any attempt, any aspiration to influence our election failed. They were not successful in doing that," Conway said. Tapper played several clips of Trump himself citing WikiLeaks on the campaign trail. "Obviously, he thought it was going to have an effect on the election," Tapper said. "Well, it had an effect on his debate answer," Conway responded. "And it had an effect on the Clinton campaign because it was quite embarrassing to watch a host of advisers question her judgment, question whether she would ever find her voice ... why she was testing 84 slogans to find out who she was and what she'd run on -- this guy had 'make America great again' and never changed." "I know that's very embarrassing. I'm sure Dems calling Chelsea Clinton a spoiled brat -- that's very uncomfortable. But that's what was hacked," she said. "The (Republican National Committee) -- apparently there was an attempted hack on the RNC, I'm informed but they had sufficient cybersecurity firewalls in place." She compared Trump citing WikiLeaks on the campaign trail to Clinton pointing to Republican senators and governors who were critical of Trump's campaign. Conway said Democrats and the Obama administration are only complaining about the Russian hacks now that Clinton has lost the election. "Everything changed when the election result was not what they had anticipated," she said. In a separate interview on "Fox News Sunday," Reince Priebus -- the Republican National Committee chairman and Trump's incoming chief of staff -- was more direct in acknowledging that Russia was behind the hacks of Democratic operatives. But he also blamed the Democratic National Committee for being hacked. "We have bad actors, including the Russians," Priebus said. "But we also have a problem when we have a major political institution that allows foreign governments into their system without any defenses and training."

Sen. Rand Paul claimed the President-elect supports the Kentucky Republican's calls to approve an Obamacare replacement on the same day Congress repeals the health care law. That'd be big news: Congressional Republicans haven't yet figured out what they'll replace Obamacare with -- and Paul is on a lonely crusade to slow down what's expected to be a vote early in the year to repeal it. Asked by CNN's Jake Tapper on "State of the Union" Sunday whether Trump and Paul agree that a replacement needs to be passed at the same time Obamacare is repealed, Conway dodged. "I can confirm that he is committed to replacing Obamacare with something that actually is affordable and accessible and allows you to buy health insurance over state lines," she said. She said Trump is working with Vice President-elect Mike Pence, congressional Republicans and his nominee for Health and Human Services secretary, former Rep. Tom Price, on how to roll back and replace the law. "He's very committed to repealing and replacing it. Mr. Trump has been very up-front about what some of those particulars are," she said. "And we also know that you have popular provisions like coverage for pre-existing conditions. We also know there are Americans relying upon it now."

The Kentucky Republican's comments came in an interview on CBS's "Face the Nation," a day after Trump had tweeted: "Having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing. Only 'stupid' people, or fools, would think that it is bad!" McConnell said Trump's hopes are probably wishful thinking. "I don't think it's all that unusual for a new president to want to get along with the Russians. I remember George W. Bush having the same hope," McConnell said. "My suspicion is, these hopes will be dashed pretty quickly," he said. "The Russians are a big adversary, and they demonstrated it by trying to mess around in our election." His comments come after Trump was briefed Friday by US intelligence community leaders on Russian President Vladimir Putin's role in directing the hacking of Democratic operatives -- and how that hacking was intended to hurt Hillary Clinton and help Trump in the 2016 presidential race.

Amy Klobuchar said Monday Congress should authorize a bipartisan commission of experts to supplement the current Capitol Hill investigations into what 17 US intelligence agencies have concluded was a Russian plot to interfere in the US election. The Minnesota senator reiterated her belief that a special expert-led investigation into the cyberintrusions allegedly perpetrated by the Russians would reveal more than any standard congressional inquiry. "When you look back through history -- say the 9/11 Commission -- you had a group of people who were devoted to working on something, not just looking at what happened in the past -- which is important -- but using the past to make recommendations for the future," she told CNN's Jake Tapper on "The Lead." "This wouldn't be a bunch of politicians, Jake, this would be experts." President-elect Donald Trump has encouraged the country to "move on" to more pressing problems. Klobuchar also brushed back any blame cast on the Obama administration for inadequate cybersecurity, saying it was the country as a whole that was unprepared for the attacks. "I don't think we were ready to think that a major nation like Russia would get into this kind of mess," she said. "Do I wish we had done things differently? Yes. Do I wish we had responded more quickly? Yes," she said. "But my question now is how do we work together across the aisle to respond more quickly."

Nominees for top Cabinet posts are grilled by senators for hours -- sometimes even days. Every club they joined, political donation they made or article they wrote is scrutinized. And while historically Cabinet appointees are almost always confirmed by the Senate, the process along the way is not always drama-free. The big battles will begin to unfold this week when some of President-elect Donald Trump's top nominees are slated to be grilled before Senate committees. Here is an inside look at the process from start to finish. In the coming weeks and months, over 1,000 executive branch officials will go through confirmation, but most will manage to get sworn in with far less fanfare than the agency heads. In order to understand Senate confirmation, you have to start with its Constitutional underpinnings. Article II, Section II, Clause II states that the president "shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the Supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for." In plain English, that means all Cabinet-level officials -- from Secretary of the Treasury to Attorney General -- and hundreds of their deputies, require Senate confirmation. That does not include to White House staff, such as President-elect Donald Trump's chief strategist Steve Bannon or incoming Chief of Staff Reince Priebus. As soon as Cabinet picks are formally announced, sharp criticism starts from political opponents and outside interest groups roll up their sleeves for battle. At the same time, nominees must fill out a host forms, including questionnaires from the White House and relevant Senate committee, an FBI background check, and financial disclosure forms. Additionally, certain Senate panels, such as the Finance Committee, require nominees to submit their tax returns. The questions asked of nominees in these forms are probing and personal: What are your financial liabilities? Have you ever been arrested? The nominee must also work with the Office of Government Ethics to devise a plan for reducing conflicts of interests while in office, and sign an ethics agreement. After all the forms are signed, then the Senate committee will get to work digging through all the mountain of materials. But the nominee's work does not end. Around this time -- in between so-called, " Then comes the nominee's big moment: The hearing. Each nominee will make a brief opening statement, but the real show starts when Senate committee members come ready to interrogate nominees in multiple rounds of televised questioning for hours (or days). Once the show is over, committee members will then vote to send the nomination to the floor for a full vote of all 100 senators. That is, assuming party opponents do not try to force delays on major posts. Even though hearings begin this week, the Senate cannot vote to confirm the nominees until after noon on January 20, and Trump becomes the 45th President. How many votes does it take to get someone officially confirmed these days? Only a simple majority of 51 votes. And Vice President-elect Mike Pence will cast the deciding vote if there is a tie. It has not always been this way. Senate rules were changed back in 2013 when then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and other top Democrats became convinced GOP delaying tactics were crippling Washington. They triggered the so-called "nuclear option" which -- over the objections of Republicans -- lowered the threshold to overcome a filibuster from 60 to 51 votes. US Supreme Court nominees were exempt from the rules change, however, and are still subject to the 60 vote filibuster threshold (for now). Given that Senate Republicans now enjoy slim majority of 52 seats in the Senate, one might predict that Trump's nominees are a shoe-in. Traditionally, that would be true. The Senate typically gives more deference on executive-branch appointments than it does on Supreme Court picks -- the theory being that Cabinet heads are not the same as lifetime appointments. But not all Cabinet nominations have sailed through Senate confirmation in the past. Dick Cheney was President George H.W. Bush's But assuming all goes well, Trump may have some company on Inauguration Day. Seven of President Barack Obama's Cabinet members were sworn in on his Inauguration Day, January 20, 2009.

Bernie Sanders and a Donald Trump supporter shared a heated moment Monday night during CNN's town hall event as the Democrat was pressed on Obama administration regulations. Jim Jacobs, who said he was a small business owner, told the Vermont senator he was concerned about the effects of what he called a raft of burdensome regulations. "The devil is in the details. We've got to see what those regulations are," Sanders said, not giving an inch. Sanders said he wouldn't rule out reconsidering some regulations, but added he didn't know which ones the man was citing. "It's very easy to blame Barack Obama for everything, by the way. Some of those regulations may be state, may be local," the Vermont senator said. "But some of them, if you're talking about -- you now, you have some folks out there who really want the freedom to pollute our air and pollute our water," he said. "They want to get rid of those regulations. I don't agree. I don't agree. We have got to protect our environment." Sanders added that while Obama raised taxes on the wealthiest Americans, he would have gone further. "Obama did raise taxes on the top 1 or 2%, and you know what? I would have gone further. I think the wealthiest people in this country are doing phenomenally well," Sanders said. "Obama did raise taxes on the top 1 or 2%, and you know what? I would have gone further.

At the same time, Sanders urged fellow Democrats against simply obstructing the incoming administration -- demonstrating the difficulty progressives are having in deciding how to handle the incoming president. Speaking at a town hall in Washington sponsored by CNN and moderated by Chris Cuomo, Sanders blasted Republicans for acting "shamefully and outrageously" by refusing to consider President Barack Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court last year. He suggested Meanwhile, Sanders, a Vermont senator and progressive favorite in the 2016 Democratic primary, acknowledged Obamacare has "problems." "But we damn well aren't going to see it repealed and have no replacement there at all," he said. And he drew another clear line with Trump, saying: "I will tell you this: He ran a campaign whose cornerstone was bigotry. It was based on sexism, on racism, on xenophobia, and on that issue, I will not compromise." Still, Sanders said he hopes Democrats don't use the "obstruct, obstruct, obstruct" tactics against Trump that congressional Republicans deployed against Obama. "I don't think that's what we do," Sanders said. "I think where Trump has ideas that make sense that we can work with him on, I think we should." Sanders wouldn't say whether he would again seek the presidency in 2020. But said there's one issue on which he would work with Trump: trade. Both railed against the North American Free Trade Agreement on the campaign trail and said they opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership. "I believe we need a new trade policy. I believe we tell corporate America they've got to control their greed," Sanders said. "Mr. Trump is prepared to sit down and work on a new trade policy which is based on fairness, not just on corporate greed, yes, I will be happy to work with him." With Hillary Clinton defeated and Obama counting down his final days in office, Democrats are increasingly reliant on Sanders, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and other leading progressives to set the party's message -- and pick its battles. Democrats face this challenge as they're poised to lose all their levers of power in Washington. Changes to Senate rules made when the party had the majority now mean its members can't block any of Trump's Cabinet nominees. Nor can Democrats stop the GOP push to repeal Obamacare using the same filibuster-avoiding budget rules Obama used to push the health reform law through Congress. The party is also down to 17 of the nation's 50 governor's offices, and Republicans have full control of the legislatures in 32 states -- realities that make it harder for Democrats to stop changes to voting access laws that have hurt the party. Sanders said Democrats have lost support among working-class voters in part because the party joined Republicans in deregulating Wall Street and enacting massive trade deals. Doing that, and then claiming the mantle of the middle class, won't work, he said. "They're not going to believe you," he said of voters. "What we have got to do is come up with an agenda that speaks to the needs of the working people." It's against that backdrop that Democrats will begin to fight back this week as they seek to make the case that Trump is selling out his working class base by tapping corporate figures such as ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson for secretary of state, Goldman Sachs veteran Steve Mnuchin for treasury secretary and fast food executive Andy Puzder for labor secretary. Sanders said he has real concerns about two of Trump's nominees -- Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions for attorney general and Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt for EPA administrator. The Vermont senator said he wants to hear what they have to say before deciding whether he'll vote against them -- but acknowledged he's not inclined to vote for either of them. "All that I am doing here is trying to be polite," Sanders said. Sanders pushed back, telling the man: "Obama did raise taxes on the top 1 or 2%, and you know what? I would have gone further. I think the wealthiest people in this country are doing phenomenally well." The questioner continued to press Sanders, who wouldn't give an inch. "The devil is in the details. We've got to see what those regulations are," he said, adding that he wouldn't rule out reconsidering some regulations, but saying he didn't know which ones the man was citing.

Then, this Sunday, Hillary Clinton attended a Broadway showing of the Color Purple where it was she, and not just the actors, who garnered the most applause.

The tug-of-war over a controversial painting displayed in the Cannon tunnel of the US Capitol continued Tuesday as Democratic Rep. William Lacy Clay re-hung the painting three times after several Republican lawmakers pulled it down, criticizing it as being anti-police. The artwork depicts some police officers as pigs. Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter first unscrewed the painting Friday, returning it to Clay's office. Clay and members of the Congressional Black Caucus ceremoniously re-hung the painting Tuesday morning. By Tuesday afternoon, it was taken down again, this time by Colorado's Doug Lamborn, who told CNN in a phone call he "did what I had to do." Undeterred, Clay and an aide hanged the painting again. Then, early Tuesday evening, Republican Reps. Brian Babin and Dana Rohrabacher teamed up to take down the artwork. Babin posted a photo on Facebook with Rohrabacher and the painting, which he called "irresponsible" and a "disgrace." Clay returned the painting to its spot at 5 p.m. ET. It's unclear whether the back-and-forth will continue, but in Tuesday morning's House Republican conference, Hunter received a round of applause from his GOP colleagues, his chief of staff, Joe Kasper, told CNN. Fellow Rep. David Reichert said he will write a letter to the Architect of the Capitol calling for the painting's removal -- again. If the architect does not remove the painting, Kasper said, House Speaker Paul Ryan told members he will take steps toward removing the painting. Each member of Congress can select a painting by a constituent to hang in the Cannon tunnel. The painting, by high school student David Pulphus, won Clay's congressional art competition last May. Members do not select the artists, do not sign off on the artistic concepts and have no role in judging the competition, Clay said. Speaking to reporters after first re-hanging the artwork earlier Tuesday morning, Clay called the saga of the painting a "manufactured controversy." He said it was "pathetic" that Republican members who "constantly refer to themselves as constitutional conservatives" would not apply "fundamental free speech rights" to the artist. Hunter also dismissed allegations that he is restricting First Amendment rights, saying the painting violated House rules. "It's not about the First Amendment, it's about the rules of the Capitol," Hunter said. "The art competition rules do not allow for this type of painting," which he described as "offensive." Still, he said on Twitter Tuesday evening that he and Clay are friends, posting a photo of them shaking hands. The law enforcement community and several members of Congress first took issue with the artwork after its existence was reported by Independent Journal Review. Clay blamed Independent Journal Review, which he described as an "alt-right blog," for stirring up the controversy. IJR is a conservative publication and a member of the News Media Alliance. IJR co-hosted a presidential debate with ABC News during the primaries. While Clay said he did not agree or disagree with the art and that he supported police, he later noted that the artwork is an indication of his 18-year-old constituent's worldview on police, citing the deaths of Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner and Michael Brown, among others. Clay said Monday he planned to file a police report against Hunter for removing the painting, but on Tuesday, he said he has no intention to litigate further. He called Hunter a "good guy," and a "friend," but said he was disappointed by his actions.

Jeff Sessions Wednesday in an unprecedented move during his attorney general confirmation. This would be the first time in Senate history that a sitting senator will testify against another sitting senator for a Cabinet post during a confirmation. "I do not take lightly the decision to testify against a Senate colleague," Booker said. "But the immense powers of the attorney general combined with the deeply troubling views of this nominee is a call to conscience." Sessions' confirmation hearings, Booker told CNN on Tuesday morning shortly before Sessions' hearing started that it was "consequential moment." "This is one of the more consequential appointments in American history right now given the state of a lot of our challenges we have with our policing, a lot of challenges we have with race relations, gay and lesbian relations," Booker said. Booker called Sessions' record "concerning in a number of ways," citing his opposition to bipartisan criminal justice reform and immigration reform, criticism of the Voting Rights Act and his "failure to defend the civil rights of women, minorities, and LGBT Americans." Donald Trump supporter Rep. Chris Collins defended Sessions Tuesday and said "Cory Booker is all about the latest stunt." "If you remember what he did when he was mayor in New Jersey, the first thing he does is he tries to grab international headlines," Collins told CNN's "New Day." "What he's doing today every -- never before in the Senate, it doesn't surprise at all." He added, "What Cory Booker is doing is nothing but self-serving grabbing headlines. Jeff Sessions is going to answer those questions." Booker has been known to work across the aisles to pass Senate legislation and worked in the Senate to restore provisions of the Voting Rights Act that were struck down by the Supreme Court. Democratic Rep. John Lewis, a civil rights icon, is also expected to testify against Sessions during his confirmation hearings. Lewis and Sessions Sessions has allies from his own party. Sen. Tim Scott, the Senate's sole African-American Republican member, released a statement of support for Sessions Monday night in advance of the hearing.

Several of the President-elect's most prominent Cabinet picks will appear on Capitol Hill this week for confirmation hearings that could be brutal. Trump will also hold his first formal news conference since the summer on Wednesday to address potential conflicts of interest that could surround his presidency. President Barack Obama will move closer to exiting the stage when he delivers a farewell address Tuesday night from Chicago. Though the inauguration is less than two weeks away, the swirl of events means Trump's presidency effectively begins this week. And as Washington moves closer to a historic transfer of power, Trump is in another pop culture feud -- this time with Meryl Streep after the actress offered a The session with reporters in New York will be his first as President-elect and the first formal new conference he has held since July. As well as ethics, Trump's refusal to accept the assessment of US spy agencies that Russia was to blame for a cyber hacking operation against Democratic servers during the election will also dominate the event. On Capitol Hill, Trump's nominees are steeling for a flurry of confirmation hearings that will give Democrats an opportunity to pose pointed questions about ethics, Russia policy and other contentious issues surrounding the new administration. Sen. Jeff Sessions, Trump's pick to become attorney general, is facing accusations of suppressing civil rights as an Alabama official. He appears before a panel of his colleagues Tuesday. Meanwhile, ExxonMobil boss Rex Tillerson, who has been named to serve as secretary of state, will face his Senate grilling Wednesday. That hearing will likely focus on his relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin and his positions on other key issues, such as global warming. The President-elect appeared before reporters at Trump Tower Monday and several times dodged questions about the intelligence community's assessment that Russia tried to interfere with the election. But he predicted smooth sailing for all of his Cabinet nominees. "Confirmation is going great," Trump said. "I think they'll all pass. ...They're all at the highest level." The timing of Trump's news conference, which will saturate media coverage, could serve to overshadow the multiple hearings scheduled for Wednesday and mute the political impact of any missteps by Trump nominees. Still, Trump's picks are taking no chances. Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway told CNN's "New Day" Monday the transition had conducted "70 hours so far of mock hearings, 2,600 questions fielded by our nominees and our designates, and we've met with 87 US senators including 37 Democrats, and we'd like to meet with the remaining Democrats." The confirmation hearings will be shadowed by a growing controversy over claims by Democrats and the director of the federal Office of Government Ethics that the transition is rushing the confirmation process in a way that prevents a comprehensive screening of nominees. But Republican Rep. Marsha Blackburn, who serves on Trump's transition team, on Monday complained that bureaucratic foot dragging -- not the reluctance of Trump nominees to provide background information -- was to blame. "Lots of times in D.C., we'll say maybe these guys need to realize they're going to have to work more than 40 hours in a week in order to get the job done and to meet a time schedule," Blackburn said on "New Day." Incoming White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer blamed Democrats for any delays. "Everyone who has a hearing this week has their paperwork in. Full stop," Spicer told reporters. The President-elect opened the week of political theatrics in typical fashion - with a Twitter storm taking on Streep. Trump tweeted that the Hollywood star was a "Hillary flunky who lost big" and denied her accusation, featured prominently in the presidential campaign and supported by video evidence, that he ridiculed a disabled New York Times reporter. "I never 'mocked' a disabled reporter (would never do that) but simply showed him ... 'groveling' when he totally changed a 16 year old story that he had written in order to make me look bad. Just more very dishonest media!" Trump wrote in consecutive tweets. The exchange between Streep and Trump seemed to underscore the country's deepening culture wars. Trump has shown no desire to rein in his social media tirades during the transition, and has characteristically hit back every time he perceives a slight is delivered against him. His habit could revolutionize the way the President communicates with the American people. While Trump and the nomination hearings will take center stage, GOP efforts to repeal Obamacare, despite the apparent lack of a plan to replace it, are gathering pace, especially in the House of Representatives. Democrats, however, emboldened by a visit from Obama to Capitol Hill last week, appear unlikely to offer the GOP any help on the issue. They're betting that Trump will take the blame if the system set up by the Affordable Care Act spins into meltdown. There were also reminders early on Monday of the restive world that Trump is inheriting, that in some cases appears to be reacting to his vow to ditch the conventions that have underpinned US foreign policy for decades. China's Global Times newspaper, which often reflects the views of the communist leadership warned that Beijing would be prepared to sever ties with Washington if Trump dumps the so-called One China policy governing ties with Taiwan. "We would like to see whether US voters will support their president to ruin Sino-US relations and destabilize the entire Asia-Pacific region," the paper wrote. North Korea, meanwhile, gave notice that it could test launch an intercontinental ballistic missile at any time - previewing what could be the first foreign policy crisis of the Trump presidency.

Elizabeth Warren gave a preview Monday of the questioning that Democrats plan to engage in during cabinet confirmation hearings that are set to begin this week. Warren slams "There is no precedent for an Education Department Secretary nominee with your lack of experience in public education," wrote Senator Warren. "While past nominees for Secretary of Education have served as teachers, school system leaders, and governors, and came to the Department of Education with deep executive experience in public education, you have held no such position. As such, your nomination provides the Senate and the public with few clues about your actual policy positions on a host of critical issues." When asked for response to Warren's letter, Trump transition team responded with a statement: "The Secretary designate is looking forward to her confirmation hearing on Wednesday and responding to questions from all members on the Senate HELP committee." The Democratic senator from Massachusetts continues by calling out DeVos's policy agenda having been "You and the organizations you led have also spent millions to promote policies that send more public funds to for-profit and virtual charter schools with no accountability for how well these schools serve students or how these taxpayer dollars are spent," Warren writes. DeVos's In a statement in November announcing her nomination, Trump complemented her credentials as an education advocate and said DeVos will change the way the US approaches education. "Betsy DeVos is a brilliant and passionate education advocate," In recent days, Warren has tweeted often about Trump's cabinet nominees, specifically about their ethics paperwork that has not yet been filed, despite the fact that their nomination hearings begin this week. In a letter to Democratic senators, Walter Schaub, the director of the Office of Government Ethics confirmed that several candidates, including DeVos, "I am not aware of any occasion in the four decades since OGE was established when the Senate held a confirmation hearing before the nominee had completed the ethics review process," wrote Schaub.

The 35-year-old businessman-turned-political strategist played a key part in his father-in-law's presidential campaign and his new position is expected to test the limit of federal anti-nepotism rules. The move comes ahead of a Wednesday news conference in which Trump is expected to detail how he plans to manage his company's potential conflicts-of-interest after he enters the White House. Kushner plans to resign from the management positions he holds at his companies, including as CEO of Kushner Companies, publisher of The Observer and positions with other organizations, and will divest from a "significant number" of his assets to comply with government ethics rules, Kushner's attorney Jamie Gorelick told CNN on Monday. Kushner also will not take a salary as he steps into the West Wing job, an official who briefed on behalf of the transition told reporters later on Monday. Top Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee issued a statement within hours of Kushner's appointment calling on the Justice Department and the Office of Government Ethics to review the appointment's legality in light of the anti-nepotism statute. "There is a strong case to be made that the White House is an "agency" for purposes of the anti-nepotism statute and that it would apply to bar Mr. Kushner's appointment as a White House staff member," wrote Rep. John Conyers, the House Judiciary Committee's ranking member, and other top Democrats on the committee, in a statement released Monday evening. Gorelick argued that the anti-nepotism statue which applies to presidential administrations excludes the White House office where Kushner would be based, though the statute is open to different interpretations. Kushner is "We have the better argument," Gorelick told CNN. "We are very confident in this position." Gorelick added that she and transition officials have been in "pretty constant" communication with the Office of Government Ethics, which offered advice into how Kushner might best be able to divest his assets and comply with ethical requirements. Kushner plans to recuse himself from "particular matters that would have a direct and predictable effect on his remaining financial interests," Gorelick said. "He will also abide by federal rules requiring impartiality in particular matters involving specific parties. These steps are consistent with federal law and executive branch practice and evidence Mr. Kushner's commitment to public service," Gorelick added in a statement provided by the Trump transition. Larry Noble, general counsel of the Campaign Legal Center and a CNN consultant, said while Kushner may be perfectly qualified "the problem is that when you hire relatives it raises questions about why." "A classic abuse of hiring authority is hiring your own relatives," he said, adding that a court could find that the anti-nepotism law applies in this case, but the "practical reality" is that these issues don't come up very often. Noble said if he was advising the President-elect and his son-in-law his advice would be: "Follow the anti-nepotism laws, they are meant to apply to the President. The point of the statute was to stop the President from hiring relatives, including son-in-laws." Ivanka Trump, meanwhile, is likely to simply retain the title of "first daughter" without taking on an official staff title, a transition official told CNN on Monday. The source said it hasn't been decided yet whether she will have a West Wing office and her specific portfolio likely won't be announced for a while. But Trump is expected to make clear in the presser that his daughter will not be running his company while he is in the White House. Even as the Trump transition is expected to announce how Kushner's appointment won't violate anti-nepotism laws, Kushner, who owns his own real estate development firm, has continued to chase deals that raise questions about conflicts of interest. Kushner met with a powerful Chinese business magnate in the week after his father-in-law's election as he sought to finalize a deal for the purchase of one of his most prized properties on Fifth Avenue, the New York Times reported, raising ethical questions. Neither Kushner nor Trump have publicly commented on the concerns of nepotism. Kushner, who is an observant Jew, first took a role in his father-in-laws' presidential campaign advising him on US policy toward Israel and helped write the speech Trump delivered to AIPAC, the pro-Israel lobby. But his role quickly ballooned from there as he became a hugely influential figure in his father-in-law's campaign, wielding power over much of the campaign's strategy and data operation. Since then, Kushner has become a key adviser and power broker to the President-elect during the transation, serving as a point of contact for powerful business interests, foreign governments and other powerful figures. Kushner and Ivanka Trump recently picked a Washington home to move into, making a role for Kushner in the White House almost inevitable.

"Just because there was a political election doesn't mean it goes away," the Utah Republican said of the Clinton investigation. He called the classified emails that surfaced on the server "the largest breach of security in the history of the State Department." The FBI decided not to recommend charges against Clinton, though their months-long investigation -- and last-minute reopening of it -- cast a pall over her campaign. Chaffetz also told reporters his committee will continue its executive oversight role xe2x80x8eand said that could include probing issues arising in the Trump administration. "My job is not to be a cheerleader for the president," he said. When asked about Trump's potential business conflicts the chairman noted that the lawxe2x80x8e exempts the president of the United States, calling the push from Democrats to launch a committee investigation on Trump's business ties "premature at best." Chaffetz also sidestepped a question about potential conflicts for Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, tapped to be a senior adviser, saying he just learned about his role. But he said he planned to talk to the incoming White House Counsel, Don McGahn, soon. On laws regarding conflicts and the president, Chaffetz said "maybe some of that should be tightened up."

"The new administration -- and any president -- needs to recognize that this is a challenging and dangerous world, and that the intelligence community and intelligence professionals can help to keep this country safe and protect our national security interests," Brennan told David Axelrod on "The Axe Files," a podcast from the University of Chicago Institute of Politics and CNN. "And any president or administration that does not recognize that is one that is putting this country's national security at great risk and peril," he added. Brennan was among the intelligence community leaders who met with Trump on Friday to present their report on Russia's role in the hacking of the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 campaign. The hacking report, and its conclusion that Russian President Vladimir Putin had conspired to help Trump, has been at the core of the President-elect's rift with the intelligence community. Brennan was resolute. "We have great confidence in our understanding, our knowledge, in our assessment of what took place," he told Axelrod on the eve of the meeting with Trump. Brennan praised Trump's selection of former Sen. Dan Coats of Indiana as the new Director of National Intelligence, and said he had hope that Trump, once in office, would gain a deeper appreciation for the work of the intelligence community. Recalling their exchanges when Coats was a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Brennan remembered the former senator as "somebody who has taken his responsibility there very seriously" and who "appreciates and applauds the work that we (the intelligence agencies) have done." "I have enjoyed my association with him," Brennan said. "I think he is somebody who would serve that position well." During the hour-long conversation with Axelrod, Brennan also offered candid assessments about the ongoing turmoil in the Middle East and fateful decisions US administrations have made over the past two decades that may have contributed to the current strife. Brennan singled out the 2003 invasion of Iraq as "the reason why there was the tremendous slide into violence and bloodshed in that part of the world." He also argued "history would have been different" if the United States had kept some troops in Iraq instead of fully withdrawing from the country in 2011. While Brennan said he does not believe the decision to leave Iraq was the root cause for the sectarian violence that has subsequently plagued the country, he does see it as "a contributing factor" to the instability that helped ISIS flourish there. "I don't believe it was the reason for it. I think it was a contributing factor to the subsequent events that took place. Because we were not there, and we weren't able to do the training, we weren't able to do the advising and the assisting," he said. "If we knew then what we know now in terms of what ISIL was able to do, in terms of just this explosive growth in Iraq that then was able to lop over into Syria, would we have pursued the same course? Probably not," Brennan said later. The counterargument, Brennan said, is a US presence could have led to the deaths of hundreds of US military personnel and been exploited by ISIS as a rallying cry. "It's so hard to determine, but history would have been different," Brennan stated. "Without a doubt, it would have been different." Similarly, more aggressive intervention in the Syrian civil war that has left nearly 500,000 dead and caused millions to flee might have made a difference, he said. "If additional support was provided by various international actors to the... Free Syrian Army, early on, might that have made a difference? Maybe," Brennan considered. "Because at that time, the Syrian regime was reeling and was more vulnerable." He cautioned, however, that providing military support earlier to the Syrian opposition -- as critics of the Obama administration's policy suggest should have been done -- would have presented its own challenges. Noting that the opposition is a "very eclectic" mix of secular and extremist elements, Brennan said, "Supporting the opposition blindly and throwing weapons over the transom into Syria could have led to a worse outcome than today." Brennan, who spent years stationed in the Middle East, offered a sober assessment about the prospect of Western-style democracies taking root in that arid terrain. "I think there were very, very unrealistic expectations in Washington, including in some parts of the administration, that the Arab Spring was going to push out these authoritarian regimes and democracy is going to flourish because that's what people want," he said. It turns out that what they actually want, he countered, was freedom "for themselves, or their group, or their tribe. But the concept of democracy is something that really is not engrained in a lot of the people and the cultures and the countries out there."

"When you tune into the Golden Globes awards show, is it always appropriate to talk politics?" Conway, Trump's campaign manager and soon-to-be senior White House adviser, said in an interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo on "New Day" Monday. "They can say what they want, but they have to be held to account," Conway said. "Look, that is a very myopic place -- that place, this network, frankly, all wanted the election to turn out a different way." Streep criticized Trump during an award acceptance speech Sunday night, lambasting his mocking of disabled New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski. Trump flailed his arms in a way that mimicked Kovaleski's disability while attacking the journalist for saying that Trump had mischaracterized his post-September 11, 2001 reporting on Muslims' reaction to the terrorist attacks. "It kind of broke my heart when I saw it, and I still can't get it out of my head, because it wasn't in a movie. It was real life," Streep said. Trump tweeted criticism of both Streep and Kovaleski on Monday morning. Conway on Monday repeated Trump's insistence that he wasn't mocking the reporter's disability and asked Cuomo, "Why can't you give him the benefit of the doubt?" Cuomo pushed back, saying that Trump was "doing a gesture that goes right to the guy's vulnerability." Conway responded that Cuomo was "giving oxygen to what Meryl Streep said." "You can't give him the benefit of the doubt on this and he's telling you what was in his heart?" Conway said. "You always want to go by what's come out of his mouth rather than look at what's in his heart." Conway also criticized Streep for failing to discuss a video in which four people broadcast their attack on a mentally disabled man -- while yelling obscenities about "white people" and Donald Trump -- live on Facebook. "If she has a great platform and a worldwide audience at that moment, why not bring attention to that recent event?" Conway said.

"I urge you to think beyond partisan politics as you consider this nomination," Khan said in a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee made public Monday. "Thirty years ago, a bipartisan group of senators rejected Mr. Sessions' nomination to be a federal judge. His record since then does not give us any reason to believe that those senators were in error." Khan, who first spoke out against Trump at last summer's Democratic National Convention, claimed the Alabama senator does not have the best interests of all Americans at heart. "The most minimal standard for leading the Department of Justice must be a demonstrated commitment to pursuing justice for all Americans. Mr. Sessions fails to meet that standard," Khan said. Sessions' has come under fire for past comments on the NAACP and the ACLU, which the senator called "unamerican." In 1986, a black assistant US attorney who worked for Sessions also testified that the Alabama senator called him "boy" on multiple occasions and joked about the Ku Klux Klan, saying that he thought Klan members were "OK, until he learned that they smoked marijuana." Sessions Khan told CNN Monday Sessions past shows him "not worthy" of serving as the country's top law enforcement officer. "He has been holding up with the groups that are racist, that are misogynist, and he had been their champion. He had been appearing on their show, he had been talking to them, he had been seeking their advice, he had been meeting with them privately and publicly, and giving them voice," Khan said. Khan said confirming Sessions could send a negative signal to the rest of the world. "Be careful who we nominate and appoint because the world watches us, and what steps we take in exercise of democracy who we make our representative, who we make our law enforcement officer for this country. And he certainly does not qualify," Khan said. "There is time to oppose, and then there is time to watch," he said. "I feel strongly that it is my moral obligation that if I have anything to say that I must say it now." Khan is not the first to speak out against Sessions.

Sessions' hearing Sessions' hearing ©The mother of Matthew Shepard is urging senators to oppose Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions' nomination to become President-elect Donald Trump's attorney general, citing his opposition to hate crimes legislation. In a report issued by the Human Rights Campaign, Judy Shepard -- whose son Matthew was beaten and left to die in Wyoming in 1998 in a crime motivated by anti-gay sentiment -- blasted Sessions for opposing the Hate Crimes Prevention Act, which President Barack Obama signed into law in 2009. A Sessions spokeswoman, meanwhile, says he would enforce hate crimes laws as attorney general -- even though he opposed them in the Senate over constitutional concerns. Judy Shepard's comments come just before Sessions' confirmation hearing, set to begin at 9:30 a.m. ET Tuesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Judy Shepard wrote that Democrats and Republicans had helped push for hate crimes legislation in Congress, but that "Senator Jeff Sessions was not one of these members." "In fact, Senator Sessions strongly opposed the hate crimes bill -- characterizing hate crimes as mere 'thought crimes.' Unfortunately, Senator Sessions believes that hate crimes are, what he describes as, mere 'thought crimes,'" she wrote. "My son was not killed by 'thoughts' or because his murderers said hateful things. My son was brutally beaten ... with the butt of a .357 magnum pistol, tied him to a fence, and left him to die in freezing temperatures because he was gay. Senator Sessions' repeated efforts to diminish the life-changing acts of violence covered by the Hate Crimes Prevention Act horrified me then, as a parent who knows the true cost of hate, and it terrifies me today to see that this same person is now being nominated as the country's highest authority to represent justice and equal protection under the law for all Americans." She wrote that Sessions "has forfeited opportunity after opportunity to stand up for people like my son Matt and has, instead, used his position of power to target them for increased discrimination and marginalization, thus encouraging violence and other acts deemed to be hate crimes." The report comes as Sessions is under fire for his stances on LGBT rights. The pro-LGBT rights Lambda Legal CEO Rachel Tiven said Monday that Sessions "has demeaned and dismissed LGBT people at every turn -- especially those of us who are also immigrants, women, and people of color. He is a lifelong opponent of civil rights, and he is unfit to serve as Attorney General." A source familiar with Sessions' thinking said he opposed hate crimes legislation in the Senate over concerns about its constitutionality, including vague terms that could have allowed re-prosecution of those who had been acquitted and the law's lack of a direct tie to Congress' power over interstate commerce. A Sessions spokeswoman said as attorney general, he would enforce hate crimes laws -- even though he did not back them as a senator. "Senator Sessions believes that all Americans, no matter their background, deserve effective protection from violence and that crimes committed on the basis of prejudice are unquestionably repugnant," said Sarah Isgur Flores, a Sessions spokeswoman. "While he may have had disagreements about what was the most effective policy to combat such crimes, as Attorney General, he will be fully committed to enforcing the laws -- even those for which he did not vote."

The "Left unchecked, the continued growth of (greenhouse gas) emissions could cause global average temperatures to increase by another 4xc2xb0C or more by 2100 and by 1.5 to 2 times as much in many midcontinent and far northern locations," Obama wrote. "Although our understanding of the impacts of climate change is increasingly and disturbingly clear, there is still debate about the proper course for U.S. policy -- a debate that is very much on display during the current presidential transition. "But putting near-term politics aside, the mounting economic and scientific evidence leave me confident that trends toward a clean-energy economy that have emerged during my presidency will continue and that the economic opportunity for our country to harness that trend will only grow," he wrote. "We have long known, on the basis of a massive scientific record, that the urgency of acting to mitigate climate change is real and cannot be ignored," he wrote, adding that "the trend toward a cleaner power sector can be sustained regardless of near-term federal policies." This is the third policy-specific article Obama has published in a prestigious journal over the past week. Obama published an essay on criminal justice reform in the Harvard Law Review and discussed his namesake health care bill in the New England Journal of Medicine. In the time after Trump's victory, the White House has acted to The President also discussed the continued struggles of the coal industry, but pointed to the market forces of cheap natural gas rather than regulations from his Environmental Protection Agency meant to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Trump and Republicans have consistently attacked Obama's EPA regulations and the President-elect, in particular, has promised to bring back coal-related jobs But the market, Obama said, means coal likely won't be coming back all the way. "Because the cost of new electricity generation using natural gas is projected to remain low relative to coal, it is unlikely that utilities will change course and choose to build coal-fired power plants, which would be more expensive than natural gas plants, regardless of any near-term changes in federal policy," Obama wrote. The President also urges Trump to keep the US as part of the historic Paris Agreement aimed to curb global warming, saying that at the very least involvement is necessary to protect US economic interests. "Were the United States to step away from Paris, it would lose its seat at the table to hold other countries to their commitments, demand transparency, and encourage ambition," Obama wrote. "This does not mean the next administration needs to follow identical domestic policies to my administration's. There are multiple paths and mechanisms by which this country can achieve -- efficiently and economically -- the targets we embraced in the Paris Agreement." "Regardless of U.S domestic policies, it would undermine our economic interests to walk away from the opportunity to hold countries representing two-thirds of global emissions -- including China, India, Mexico, European Union members, and others -- accountable. In addition to pledging to curb Obama-era environmental regulations, Trump has previously questioned the science showing man-made greenhouse gas emissions causing increases in global temperatures and associated impacts such as rising sea levels.

They are looking at folding some new health care provisions as part of the bill to repeal Obamacare, a proposal that Congress could enact as soon as this month, according to senior GOP aides and a top party leader. It's unclear what new provisions -- if any -- the GOP will ultimately include in the repeal bill. But the fact that they are now actively discussing this idea is an implicit recognition that they need to move more quickly to replace at least aspects of a law they are determined to repeal immediately. "We're looking at trying to find some way to do that," said Sen. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican leader, when asked about adding new provisions in the repeal bill. "We're looking to do as much as we can do in the (repeal) bill." Cornyn would not specify which provisions of the law could be replaced immediately, largely because it depends on what would be allowed under Senate budget rules. To repeal the law, Congress plans to move first on a budget resolution that will pass as soon as this week. After the resolution passes, Congress must pass a separate budget bill to repeal major aspects of the law -- something that cannot be filibustered by Democrats under the rules of the Senate. It's uncertain what elements of the law the GOP will initially target. Republicans had been discussing using the next two years to replace Obamacare, an idea that has been increasingly criticized by members of their own party. Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee warned Republicans Monday it would be "problematic," "not very appealing" and "doesn't seem very intelligent" to repeal the law without a replacement. "To me, it's much more prudent to figure out where you're going to go from here, and attempt to do it all at the same time," Corker told CNN. "People will see some of the flaws in just repealing only."

The accusations, which were published in last week's US intelligence report, claimed that Russian President Vladimir The campaign -- which consisted of hacking Democratic groups and individuals, including Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, and releasing that information via third-party websites, including WikiLeaks -- amounted to what the intelligence report called "a significant escalation" in longtime Russian efforts to undermine "the US-led liberal democratic order." But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the charges against Russia "were not backed by anything" and were "made on a very amateur, emotional level." "What we see is ... that all of this looks like is a full-scale witch hunt," he said. "We understand that our US colleagues, during various stages of their history, have gone through such witch hunts, we remember these stages of history, we know that they are replaced with more sober experts, more sober approaches that are after all aimed at a dialogue, not at emotional fits," Peskov added. "We still don't know what data have been used by those who come up with these unfounded accusations," Peskov told reporters during a conference call. "We still categorically reject any involvement of Moscow, any involvement of official and unofficial persons in the Russian Federation in the hacker attacks," he said. The "We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election. Russia's goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump," the report said. The report also stated that Moscow used a variety of tactics in a bid to sway the outcome. "Moscow's influence campaign followed a Russian messaging strategy that blends covert intelligence operations -- such as cyberactivity -- with overt efforts by Russian government agencies, state-funded media, third-party intermediaries and paid social media users or 'trolls,'" the report found. The US intelligence community released several new pieces of information to support its conclusions. It noted that in the final run-up to the election, when polls favored Clinton to win the election, Moscow shifted its campaign to influence the election to one aimed at undermining the validity of the electoral results. US intelligence officials also assessed "with high confidence" that the GRU Russian intelligence agency "used the Guccifer 2.0 persona, DCLeaks.com, and WikiLeaks to release US victim data obtained in cyberoperations publicly." The intelligence community also assessed "with high confidence" that the GRU provided WikiLeaks with the material they obtained from hacking the Democratic National Committee and top Democratic officials. The report, which was commissioned by President Barack Obama, comes as Trump has continued to resist the US intelligence community's conclusions that Russia was responsible for the hacking and that it aimed to help his campaign. The President-elect was briefed Friday on the report by top US intelligence and law enforcement officials, and while he said he had "a constructive meeting," he declined to publicly agree with their conclusions. Instead, he stressed that "there was absolutely no effect on the outcome (of the election) whatsoever," which the US intelligence community asserted in its report it was not in a position to assess. Trump did acknowledge in his statement the possibility that Russia could have been behind the hack, though he named China as well as a persistent cyberhacker. The US intelligence community also warned in its report Friday that Moscow would likely continue to pursue cyberhacking campaigns to influence future elections. "Moscow will apply lessons learned from its Putin-ordered campaign aimed at the US presidential election to future influence efforts worldwide, including against US allies and their election processes," it assessed. On Monday, Peskov confirmed to reporters that a meeting between Trump and Putin "is going to take place" but did not give a timeframe for such an encounter. "If some contacts are planned, they will be planned very carefully," he said. "We're talking about contacts after a very tense phase in the evolution of our relations, in the degradation of our relations. "That's why, of course, any contacts on the highest level will be very carefully arranged." "That's why, of course, any contacts on the highest level will be very carefully arranged." ©Cutting deals in smoke filled rooms of the Capitol doesn't happen anymore. Sipping scotch in a senator's hideaway to help find compromise is mostly a relic of a time gone by. But there is still a safe zone for senators to get to know each other across party lines and even negotiate bills: the Senate gym. It turns out that's where top Senate Democrats have gotten to know Jeff Sessions, one of their most conservative colleagues and President-elect Trump's nominee for attorney general. In at least one instance, breakthrough legislating began in the locker room . "It was like a miracle," recalled Sen. Dick Durbin, the number two Democrat who collaborated with Sessions on a bill in 2010. At the time Durbin was trying to reduce the penalty for crack cocaine, which was 100 times higher than for powder cocaine. Durbin explained that the two lawmakers were at an impasse until he saw Sessions in the gym. "We both showered, we're putting on clothes on, about to leave," explained Durbin. "I said 'Jeff, give me a number. If you can't do one-to-one, and I won't go for 100 to one, what is it?' It was 18. I can't tell you why but it was 18. We agreed." The legislation passed in the Senate and the House and was signed into law by President Obama that August. But those bipartisan compromises were few and far between, which is why politics and policy differences are likely to supersede good will when it comes to supporting Sessions' confirmation. Last week, Durbin, who sits on the Judiciary Committee, met with Sessions about his nomination. When asked whether there is any chance that he could support his colleague as attorney general of the United States, Durbin was diplomatic but frank. "I want to give him a chance to answer questions under oath at the hearing. That's only fair," Durbin explained. "But when he came to my office I can tell you it was not a new Jeff Sessions. He was stuck to positions that I know he's held for years and years. And some of them are very difficult for me to accept." The top Senate Democrat, Chuck Schumer, is also a gym buddy of Jeff Sessions. Schumer recounted recently telling his colleague from Alabama that if he were up for a different post it might be easier. "I said to Jeff Sessions in the gym the other day, if he made you trade -- head of the trade representative, we'd be working together very well." The New Yorker cited policy differences with Sessions on immigration and civil rights. "You know, we can kibitz in the gym," Schumer said. "You keep these positions on immigration, you keep these positions on civil rights and voting rights, it's going to be very hard for me to support you." Still, for Democrats to even admit to liking Sessions or working with him at all is a big change from the way the Alabama Senator was viewed when he was first elected in 1996. At that point, what most senators knew about Sessions was from the experience of rejecting his nomination for the federal bench in 1986. Sessions was accused of calling a black lawyer "boy," and calling civil rights groups like the NAACP "un-American," allegations which Sessions vigorously denied. Fast forward to 2009, then-Sen. Sessions became the top ranking Republican on the very Judiciary panel that blocked him from a lifetime appointment in the judicial branch all those years ago. He used that occasion to give us a rare interview on the subject. "That was not fair. That was not accurate. Those were false charges and distortions of anything that I did, and it really was not. I never had those kind of views and I was caricatured in a way that was not me," Sessions told CNN in a 2009 interview. For the past 20 years Sessions has had a chance to prove that to Senate colleagues. Now when he goes before the same committee that rejected him in 1986, Sessions has the benefit of two decades as senator - many of which he spent on the committee that will once gain decide his fate - this time for attorney general. Sen. Susan Collins, a moderate Republican elected to the Senate the same year as Sessions in 1996, admits that she and Sessions "don't agree on a host of issues," but she was happy to accept his request to introduce him at his confirmation hearing alongside senior Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby. "He's a decent, honorable, patriotic individual," Collins said in an interview in her Senate office. "I felt bad he was not getting a fair shake from those who were denigrating him." The Maine lawmaker is referring to allegations of racial insensitivity -- the same Democrats used to block Sessions from moving through committee thirty years ago. Collins explained that she is basing her endorsement of Sessions' character on her own experience working with him over the past 20 years. Despite their differences on many policy issues, Collins said she got to know Sessions personally at "unguarded" dinners that their Senate class held when they were first elected. "I don't know what happened more than 30 years ago, when Jeff was nominated to be a district court judge, and his nomination failed," she said. "But I do know the Jeff sessions that I have worked with in the past 20 years. And he is a good person, and I believe that he will perform very well as attorney general." Another Republican colleague who went out of his way to get to know Sessions is Sen. Tim Scott, the only African-American GOP senator. In December, Scott invited Sessions to visit his home state of South Carolina, where the two lawmakers met with criminal justice professionals in Charleston. "Before I vote for him to be our attorney general, I want to know what's in his heart," Scott told The Post and Courier at the time, "not what he allegedly said back in 1986." Despite personal relationships Sessions has made with Senate colleagues over the years, his staunch conservative views, especially on immigration, has sometimes put him at odds with those in his own party. And Sessions bucked his party politically at times as well. The starkest example of that in recent years was when he decided to endorse Donald Trump for president during the GOP primaries. Sessions was the first US Senator to back the businessman. That vote of confidence from a rock-ribbed conservative gave the New York reality television star some much needed credibility with the Republican base. Now it is up to Sessions Senate colleagues to determine whether Trump's attempt to pay back Sessions' loyalty will succeed.

"These actions were wrong then, just as they would be wrong today," Kerry said in a statement issued by the department in his name. "On behalf of the Department, I apologize to those who were impacted by the practices of the past." While lauding what his State Department had done for its employees and around the globe, Kerry said the discriminatory practices had included requiring some LGBT employees to resign or not to hire job applicants because of their sexual orientation. Kerry said the discrimination dated back to the 1940s, although he noted that the department was "among many public and private employers" that acted similarly. Only 11 days remain in Kerry's tenure as Secretary of State. He has spent his final weeks primarily mired in crossfire over a United Nations resolution that condemned Israeli settlement construction, a policy fight Kerry sought to reframe in a high-profile speech. Kerry has been under pressure in recent weeks to issue a public apology. In November, Sen. Ben Cardin, a Maryland Democrat who is the ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, In a statement Monday welcoming the apology, Cardin said he plans move forward with legislation "that adds the Senate's voice to this important issue," and that will address his "on-going commitment to building an inclusive foreign policy and development workforce that represents all Americans." Cardin's call has been echoed by LGBT rights groups, "While it may not be possible to make up for the damage that was done decades ago," HRC's Government Affairs Director David Stacy wrote at the time, "these small but crucial gestures would help to set the right tone at your Department as it enters a new and uncertain time in our country." Kerry has been recognized from taking pro-LGBT steps while in office, including creating the position of Special Envoy for the Human Rights of LGBTI Persons. That position is currently held by senior career foreign service officer Randy Berry, who advocates for LGBT rights around the world on behalf of the US government. ©Republicans warned seven years ago that a health care law passed only by Democrats -- with no support from the other party -- would struggle to survive. The party-line vote to pass Obamacare, they said, was arrogant and reckless. Now, the GOP is in charge, and poised to run afoul of its own warnings. As Republican lawmakers begin to dismantle President Barack Obama's landmark health care law, awaiting the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, they face the prospect of overhauling the American health insurance system without any help from across the aisle. Democrats appear increasingly determined to offer Trump's party as little help as possible. GOP efforts to revamp the Affordable Care Act -- some 20 million people are covered through Obamacare while many more have been less directly impacted by the law -- are poised to disrupt millions of Americans' health insurance. If repealing and replacing the ACA ultimately becomes a purely partisan Republican exercise, Obamacare could emerge one of the biggest political liabilities for Trump and his party -- just as it became a problem for Democrats. Republicans sought to paint the Democrats' passing Obamacare without GOP support as extreme. Democrats are happy to return the favor. Making the difficult task of enacting healthcare reform a millstone for Republicans could end up helping Democrats in the 2018 midterm elections Former Health and Human Services Secretary Mike Leavitt, a Republican, said an overhaul of Obamacare would only have "long-term viability" if the GOP can win support from Democratic lawmakers. "The GOP has indicated publicly that they intend not to make the same mistake that the Democrats did in passing a bill that was not supported in a bipartisan way," Leavitt said. "I think that's wise." But Democratic votes won't be easy to get. In a Capitol Hill pep talk Wednesday, Obama urged Democrats not to "rescue" Republicans by helping them pass replacement measures, according to sources in the room. He also floated this idea: After the meeting, a White House aide said Obama used "Trumpcare" as an indication he was open to Trump taking credit for improvements. That is, of course, if Democrats see any changes they like. Sen. Dick Durbin, the second-ranking Democrat in the chamber, told CNN that Republicans would be making a serious mistake by moving ahead with reforming Obamacare on a purely partisan basis. Durbin went as far as to criticize Republicans for refusing to partner with Democrats on making incremental improvements to Obamacare over the years. "We've had six years of opportunities to work together on a bipartisan basis to improve or change the Affordable Care Act. They have never, ever, accepted an invitation for that," Durbin said. "Their approach is: repeal it, and once you've repealed it, then we'll think of something new. That's not a responsible approach." Not that Obama and Democrats didn't try. After Obama took office in 2009, his administration's initial efforts to win over Republican support for healthcare reform went nowhere as one by one, potential GOP allies turned their backs -- and Republican leaders were happy to paint the law as single party over-reach. The healthcare reform bill that landed on the president's desk in March 2010 had not received support from a single GOP lawmaker in the House or Senate. "The ACA stands in contrast to just about every other piece of major social welfare legislation in the history of this county, which is usually done with bipartisan support," said Tevi Troy, deputy secretary of Health and Human Services under President George W. Bush. GOP Rep. Phil Roe, a physician who last week introduced a repeal and replace Obamacare bill in the House, said the law was a "disaster" in large part because Democrats passed it without GOP input. "I never understood why healthcare is Republican or Democrat issue. I've never seen a Republican or Democrat heart attack in my life," Roe said. "There were nine physicians in the Doctors Caucus at that time. Not one of us was asked one thing about that healthcare bill." Well before the law was passed, Republicans have used promises to block then repeal Obamacare -- a phrase the GOP started using as a pejorative -- as a And now that the GOP has the opportunity to dismantle Obamacare, there is no expectation that the party will garner any support from Democrats. In fact, the vehicle that Republicans are using to roll back major pieces of the law -- a budget resolution followed by a budget reconciliation bill -- is a fast-track process that will allow the GOP to But when it comes to the second and much more complicated task of overhauling Obamacare -- replacing what gets repealed -- Republicans don't yet have a plan. GOP leaders have so far indicated a preference for the "repeal and delay" approach: passing a repeal bill as soon as possible but delaying the repeal measures from going into effect for several years as they develop a measure to replace the law. But already, rank-and-file Republicans are expressing reservations about moving too fast on repeal when there is little clarity on replace -- and Department Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell will warn Congress of the dangers of repeal without replace during a speech Monday in Washington. "If the Affordable Care Act is repealed without a replacement, the damage to the country's individual insurance market will begin this spring," Burwell will say, according to excerpts. "If health insurance companies don't know what the market will look like going forward, many will either raise prices or drop out. That means more Americans won't be able to afford coverage, and others won't be able to find it at all." In a sudden role reversal, Republicans are now labeling Democrats obstructionists when it comes to the healthcare law. "I think it's very unfortunate that (Senate Minority Leader) Chuck Schumer has essentially said he's not interested in cooperating," GOP Sen. John Barrasso told CNN in an interview. Barrasso and his fellow Republicans -- including the President-elect -- are also pressuring Democrats to cooperate. "It is time for Republicans & Democrats to get together and come up with a healthcare plan that really works - much less expensive & FAR BETTER!" Trump tweeted last week. Democrats vehemently oppose repealing Obamacare, and only a handful of lawmakers -- moderates and those hailing from conservative areas -- are likely to show a willingness to discuss replacement efforts with Republicans. Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, a moderate Democrat, declined to attend Obama's meeting on Capitol Hill with Democrats last week because he said he opposes any purely partisan conversations about Obamacare. "I would just caution my friends on the Republican side: the division we've seen in the country is because we had a bill that was passed in 2009 ... without any bipartisan support and now it's about to be repealed without any bipartisan support." Manchin told CNN. "You gotta be careful, throwing the baby out with the bathwater."

Democrats are likely to focus on Trump's cozy ties with Russia -- as well as his unexplored foreign policy positions -- in hearings for posts including defense secretary and homeland security secretary. Lawmakers have also pressed Republicans to delay hearings or confirmation votes, saying they have not been properly vetted. As of Friday, the Office of Government Ethics told Democratic senators it had not received drafts of ethics forms from several nominee who have hearings this week. Hearings for the CIA director and education secretary have been delayed. The fireworks could begin at the first hearing for a Trump nominee. Sessions, the Alabama senator -- once a US attorney and state attorney general -- has long faced accusations of racism. He wasn't confirmed for a federal judgeship in 1986 after ex-colleagues testified he had made racist comments and joked that his problem with the Ku Klux Klan was its use of marijuana. The personal relationships Sessions has developed with senators since he was first elected in 1996 -- and the close relationship between Sessions, who was among Trump's earliest and strongest supporters in the Senate, and the President-elect -- are Sessions' strongest assets. Kelly was previously the head of US Southern Command, putting much of the US' immediate vicinity under his purview -- including the control of Guantanamo Bay. Trump has pledged the US will redouble its focus on its southern border and overhaul its approach to terror threats. The ExxonMobil CEO's work in foreign hot spots -- including Russia, Saudi Arabia and Yemen -- and his business acumen are among the reasons Trump selected him as America's top diplomat. But Tillerson's relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin -- including the reception of Russia's Order of Friendship -- and will also come under intense scrutiny, because Tillerson has yet to weigh in on a host of foreign policy matters, including US sanctions on Russia in the wake of its incursion in Crimea. Tillerson is also likely to face the brunt of questions about Trump's own public cheerleading for Putin and Russia. Tillerson won't be the only nominee whose hearing will be dominated by Russia. Kansas GOP Rep. Expect Democrats to open fronts on torture, transparency, surveillance and unfiltered, fact-based assessments. Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon is the most liberal member of that committee, and he will likely hit the surveillance issue, and California Sen. Dianne Feinstein has been very vocal on the torture report. The billionaire education reformer will be a litmus test on the school reforms -- particularly vouchers and charter schools -- championed for years by conservatives, including former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. But she has no experience working in education. DeVos, Democrats are certain to point out, has never worked as a teacher or school administrator, and sent her children to private school. That disconnect is unusual for a post leading the nation's education department, which doles out dollars to the public schools that DeVos acknowledges her positions threaten. Chao has been in this position before, when she was nominated as President George W. Bush's secretary of Labor. She also has a history at the Department of Transportation, as deputy secretary during the George H.W. Bush administration. Chao would play a key role in for the administration in getting an infrastructure measure through Congress and directing spending through DOT. Her husband is Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. The retired general nicknamed "Mad Dog" and known for once quipping that it's "fun to shoot some people" is known for leading the Battle of Fallujah in Iraq and is widely respected on Capitol Hill. His hearing, though, is another likely to turn into another referendum on Trump's approach to Russia -- as well as the President-elect's untested plans to combat ISIS in Syria and Iraq. Carson -- like Trump -- was part of the 2016 Republican presidential primary's political newcomer class. His story of a hardscrabble upbringing in Detroit, overcoming his own violent tendencies before becoming a leading brain surgeon at Johns Hopkins, and his religious faith shot him to conservative stardom. But Carson also has no experience in public housing or urban policy. His most direct step into housing policy came in an op-ed in which he criticized the Obama administration's efforts to shift public housing out of lower-class, minority-dominated neighborhoods. Ross, a New York billionaire businessman, is likely to face tough questioning from Democrats eager to portray his record as at odds with Trump's populist appeal to working Americans during the campaign. Should he be confirmed, Ross is expected to have an outsized impact on US trade policy compared to past Commerce secretaries as he would be put in charge of overseeing US trade policy and renegotiating existing trade deals, in line with Trump's campaign pledges. ©A US Navy ship fired warning shots at Iranian boats on Sunday near the Strait of Hormuz, US Defense officials said Monday. Five Iranian vessels approached the The Mahan, a destroyer, fired warning shots and used radio calls, flares, bells and whistles to signal to the ships to stay away. There was no response to the radio calls. A US helicopter overhead dropped smoke grenades. Pentagon spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis said the boats came "within 900 yards or so" of the Mahan. "It's somewhat out of character, recently anyway, from what we've seen out of Iran," Davis said. Referring to other similar encounters, Davis said there had been "a total of 35 in 2016 that were assessed to be unsafe and unprofessional," and he added that "the vast majority of those were in the first half of 2016." "We had a significant number of these before, they had largely stopped except, you know, this incident and in August seemed to be one-offs," he continued. Warning shots were fired in that August incident, too. The incident began with a routine shadowing by one regular Iranian navy ship as the Mahan; the Four small inshore attack crafts began harassing the US ships, with six separate approaches by the Iranians over a nine-hour period, essentially the whole period of the transit, sources said. Only one approach was deemed unprofessional, and that resulted in the firing of warning shots because they approached Mahan at a high speed. The approach was at 15 to 20 knots and if not stopped at a distance of 500 yards or more could have been dangerous for the US ship, the sources said. As a result, defensive measures were taken. During the interaction, Iran put up a small unmanned aerial vehicle. Cmdr. Bill Urban with U.S. Naval Forces Central Command said the Mahan established radio communications with the four crafts from Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy and "issued multiple radio and visual warnings to remain clear." He said the vessels sloughed off the warnings and "continued to directly approach Mahan at a high rate of speed," prompting "three warning shots with a crew-served .50-caliber machine gun." The ships then "arrested their high-speed approach," Urban said. Naval Forces Central Command regards the interaction "as unsafe and unprofessional" because of their "high-speed approach on Mahan with weapons manned." The command cited the vessels' disregard for repeated warnings via radio, audible siren, and ships' whistle. The incident is the latest tense encounter between the two countries in and over waters near Iran in recent months. These brushes have included Iranian rocket launches, drones flying over US vessels and They've come against the backdrop of renewed US diplomatic contacts with Iran, which has triggered a political backlash among Iranian hardliners, including Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guard Corps. In November, a The helicopter was flying overhead when the Iranians trained a weapon on it, according to a defense official. The Iranians did not fire. The event took place as the helicopter was escorting the aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower on its way out of the Persian Gulf.

Calling such a move a disservice to the American people, White House spokesman Josh Earnest declared GOP lawmakers were buckling under pressure from the soon-to-be Republican president. "It does appear now that Republicans in the Senate are forming their own 'cheap suit caucus.' That's not a commentary on their wardrobe, it's a commentary on the fact they are folding and rubber stamping ... the nominees of the incoming Trump administration," Earnest said, suggesting the moves run counter to Trump's campaign message. "It sounds like a lot of Americans who voted to drain the swamp aren't getting what they hoped for, even before their guy takes office," he said. Democrats complained over the weekend that Senate Republicans, in conjunction with Trump's transition team, were rushing the confirmations of key Cabinet picks before the required vetting by the Office of Government Ethics. A slate of confirmation hearings is set to begin this week for the nominees Trump has put forward, many of whom come with complex financial holdings. The ethics panel said it hasn't yet certified the paperwork that's been filed for many of the nominees. Democrats in a letter said the front-loaded schedule of confirmation hearings had "created undue pressure on OGE's staff and agency ethics officials to rush through these important reviews." Trump's transition countered that all the required paperwork was filed, and that final certification from the ethics office wasn't required for the hearings to proceed. "Everyone who has a hearing this week has their paperwork in," Sean Spicer, a transition spokesman and the incoming White House press secretary, said Monday. Earnest insisted that some of Trump's nominees carry "obvious conflicts of interest" and that it was an "egregious" breach of precedent to hold hearings before the ethics office signed off on disclosure paperwork. He sought to contrast the Obama administration's own record on ethics when asked about the prospects of Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner assuming a senior role in the West Wing. Federal anti-nepotism laws bar federal managers from hiring a relative. "I'll let President-elect Trump select whomever he would like to have around him, and obviously that's what he will do," Earnest said. "I can tell you President Obama, and all of us who served on his senior staff here at the White House, went to great lengths to comply with the strict ethical requirements that the American people people expect from the people who are entrusted with so much authority." He said Obama's team took steps to "not just abide by the letter of the law when it comes to ethics, but actually to aspire to a higher standard."

Speaking at a news conference broadcast on Periscope Monday, the founder and editor-in-chief of WikiLeaks said the report was "embarrassing to the reputation of the US intelligence services." A report from US i The intelligence community also assessed "with high confidence" that the GRU provided WikiLeaks with the material it obtained from hacking the Democratic National Committee and top Democratic officials. Assange hit back by labeling the report a "press release" and criticized the Obama administration for politicizing the US intelligence services. "Most of this so-called intelligence report is not even fabricated," he said, suggesting there wasn't enough in it to be made up. "It does not even make assertions for the most part... it uses speculative terms... it engages us in sneaky conflations... How good a report is it as an intelligence report from 1 to 10? The evidentiary weight is literally zero. There is no evidence of any kind supplied," Assange said. Assange spoke from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where he's been holed up for more than four years to avoid facing sexual assault charges in Sweden and a potential extradition to the United States. He gave little away when asked by CNN whether WikiLeaks acted as a go-between as suggested by the report. "We can't play 20 questions to our sources. Each piece of information you disclose about the source narrows the scope of any investigation... if our sources were, for example, a state, we would have a lot less concern in attempting to protect them." The report was the first official, full and public accounting by the US intelligence community of its assessment of Russian cyberhacking activities during the 2016 presidential campaign and election, and the motivations behind that hacking. On Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists in a conference call that the charges against Russia "were not backed by anything" and were "What we see is ... that all of this looks like is a full-scale witch hunt." "What we see is ... that all of this looks like is a full-scale witch hunt." ©Democrats looking to attack President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for secretary of labor, Andrew Puzder, unveiled new findings Tuesday detailing the work environment at restaurants in his fast food empire. A pro-worker organization, Restaurant Opportunities Centers United, At the events, workers from CKE restaurants, which include Carl's Jr. and Hardees, spoke about mistreatment they experienced working at the fast food locations. A substantial number of those who participated also said they and their coworkers have prepared food despite being sick. The report did not distinguish which franchises the workers came from. The allegations, ROC United says, should call into question Puzder's nomination as labor secretary. The Labor Department has traditionally been the enforcer of labor laws and protector of workers. Since his nomination, Puzder has faced criticism from Democrats that he is too pro-employer and anti-worker. "Workers at CKE restaurants have spoken of extensive wage and hour violations and excessive rates of sexually harassing behavior from guests and customers associated with a brand that has sought to sexualize women as a hamburger-marketing tool," the report concludes. "These findings call into question the viability of Andrew Puzder for the role of the nation's secretary of labor." A Trump transition spokeswoman slammed the report in advance as "fake," criticizing the ROC's methods. "The Restaurant Opportunities Center survey -- paid for by unions and special interests opposed to Andy Puzder's nomination -- is a flagrant example of 'fake news,' " said spokeswoman Liz Johnson. "In a deliberate attempt to smear CKE and Mr. Puzder, ROC used leading questions and deceitful surveying tactics, such as posing as CKE corporate representatives, to fabricate results that are the definition of 'fake news.' " ROC United said it stands by its methodology. As part of the report, ROC United collected first-hand accounts from more than one dozen of the survey respondents, who detail the mistreatment they received. "It was not uncommon for coworkers of mine to come in sick," said Ashlee Sutphin of Tennessee. "I can recall multiple instances when the cooks in the back would be puking off into the garbage can and then finish up an order. Employees routinely worked while having pneumonia. We also couldn't plan when to make doctor visits because we would get the schedule on Saturday for Monday -- meaning we would only have a two day notice of our upcoming schedule." Sutphin and others also described grease burns suffered in the kitchen. "While working on the grill, many of the employees, including myself, would get burned from the grease that would shoot up from the sizzling hot grill," Sutphin said. "When I asked about obtaining burn cream to alleviate the pain, I was told that they did not have any at the time. Over time I realized that this wasn't on accident -- they in fact never had burn cream during future incidents. Basic medicinal items like a first-aid kit or band aids were absent from our store." A member of ROC United, Roberto Ramirez, also described working hours off the clock. "For many years, I started working 30 minutes before my clock-in time to make sure that I finished all my duties on time," Ramirez said. "My managers were aware that I was working those extra 30 minutes but I was never paid for that time or asked to clock in when I started working early. Managers would become very upset if I didn't finish my duties before the end of my shift, and several times they retaliated against me for it -- they would cut my hours, change my schedule or send me home early." Warren, Murray and 21 other Democratic senators have sent a letter to the Republican chairman of the committee that will hear Puzder's nomination asking for witnesses like the ones that will speak on Tuesday to testify before Puzder's confirmation hearing, citing accusations like those raised by ROC United. In a statement after his nomination last month, Warren called Puzder's nomination a "slap in the face." "Throughout his entire career, Andrew Puzder has looked down on working people," Warren said, "At Hardees and Carl's Jr., he got rich squeezing front-line workers on wages, overtime, and benefits, all while plotting to replace them with machines that are so much better than workers because they are 'always polite' and 'never take a vacation.' Appointing Puzder to run the federal agency responsible for protecting workers is a slap in the face for every hard working American family." But his spokeswoman defended Puzder as a job creator. "Andy Puzder has firsthand experience creating jobs and boosting the careers of thousands of Americans, and his extensive record of fighting for workers makes him the ideal candidate to lead the Department of Labor," Johnson said.

FBI director James Comey told a Senate panel that there was "penetration on the Republican side of the aisle and old Republican National Committee domains" no longer in use. Republicans have previously denied their organizations were hacked. The testimony came in a Senate intelligence committee hearing that examined Russia's intrusions in the 2016 election campaign and its intentions, with America's top intelligence officials testifying just days after they released an unclassified report blaming Moscow for the hacks. Comey later added that "there was evidence of hacking directed at state-level organizations, state-level campaigns, and the RNC, but old domains of the RNC, meaning old emails they weren't using. None of that was released." Comey said there was no sign "that the Trump campaign or the current RNC was successfully hacked." Asked by Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, whether the hacker had the ability to selectively leak that old information, Comey indicated that they did. Comey also said that the Russians "got far deeper and wider into the (Democratic National Committee) than the RNC," adding that "similar techniques were used in both cases." Comey said the FBI would have preferred to "get access to the original device or server" that was the target of hacking at the DNC. CNN previously reported that the Democratic National Committee "rebuffed" a request from the FBI to examine its computer services after it was allegedly hacked by Russia during the 2016 election.xc2xa0 The FBI instead relied on the assessment of a third-party security company called CrowdStrIke. Comey told senators thatxc2xa0the "highly respected private company eventually got access and shared" the evidence with the FBI.xc2xa0 Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told the Senate committee, examining the cyber breaches, that the intelligence community concluded with "high confidence" that Russia hacked the election to "denigrate" Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and contrast her unfavorably to Republican Donald Trump. "We have multiple high-quality sources that contribute to that assessment," Clapper said. "Attributing cyber operations is difficult but not impossible." When Arkansas Republican Sen. Tom Cotton asked whether Russian President Vladimir Putin thought Trump was going to be the likely winner, Clapper responded, "Initially, no. They thought he was a fringe candidate and didn't think that at all." Clapper said the intelligence community's report on the hacking was based on a variety of sources, including technical data, open-source information and human sources as well. He declined to offer more detail on how the information was collection in order to protect sources. CIA Director John Brennan said that had called the director of a Russian intelligence agency behind the hacks and warned the Russians that they were playing with fire, a message the Russian said he'd pass on to Putin. Clapper said that the response to activist attacks of this sort has to be carefully considered. "It's not our call what to do in response," he said of the intelligence community. He said that policy makers and politicians should "consider the whole range of tools to respond." "The challenge you get into with cyber for cyber, of course, you also have to consider the counter-retaliation to that," Clapper said. "While we spend a lot of time worrying about precision and being surgical, our adversaries" might not be that careful. Clapper was asked whether intelligence agencies had found that people close to Trump had business interests that would make the Russians predisposed to favor Trump. "The Russians just believed, or came to the conclusion, that because the President-elect is a businessman, that he would be easier to make deals with than the Democrats," Clapper said. There were frequent questions about ties between the Trump campaign and Russia during the hearing. Earlier on, Comey refused to comment on whether the FBI is investigating any potential connections. "I would never comment on investigations," Comey told Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat who repeatedly pushed the FBI director to release any information it had before Inauguration Day. "If it doesn't happen before Jan. 20, I'm not sure it's going to happen," Wyden said. But Sen. Angus King of Maine, an Independent, alluded tartly to Comey's very public statements about investigations into Clinton during the election campaign -- "the irony of you making that statement I cannot avoid." Comey said that there was a difference between open and closed investigations. He pushed back on King, saying, "You asked me if you have any pending investigations and we're not going to talk about that." He added that "I'm tone deaf on politics and that's as it should be." Tuesday's hearing is the first public examination of Russia's activities since Trump received a briefing from the country's top intelligence officials on Moscow's interference in the presidential election. The 17 US intelligence agencies already issued a statement in October expressing their unanimous assessment that Moscow had probed state election voting centers and penetrated the email accounts of Democratic groups and individuals. Much of that information was made public through the organization WikiLeaks, lead by Julian Assange. In the classified and declassified reports released last week, they outlined their findings that Putin directly ordered the "influence campaign." Republicans and Democrats both called for a thorough investigation into Russia's hacking of the presidential election Tuesday, reaffirming their confidence in US intelligence agencies' findings even as Trump has continued to downplay them. The report "gives me no reason to doubt the findings," said the chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, North Carolina Republican Richard Burr. "We owe it to the American people to do an independent and bipartisan review." After the conclusion of the public session, Burr said that the hearing would continue in a classified setting. Congressional Democrats are pushing for a bipartisan, independent commission to look into the hacks. California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein said last week that she and other senators will soon introduce a similar bill, while House lawmakers introduced one in early December and re-introduced it again last week. Republicans have preferred to limit investigations to congressional committees they control. On Tuesday, the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee, California's Adam Schiff, said "the seriousness of these allegations warrant the most thorough and non-partisan of investigations." Another California Democrat on the committee, Eric Swalwell, said the "best way forward is to have an independent, bipartisan commission that can depoliticize this. The Democrats were the victims this time," but "it could be the Republicans next time. The constant should be that both parties care about our democracy. There's plenty of room for Republicans to come on board." In the final run-up to Nov. 9, Russia shifted its focus from influencing the campaign to undermining the validity of the results, a theme that Trump himself began to stress on the campaign trail, telling people the election was going to be "rigged."

The moves -- one announced late Monday and the second early Tuesday -- came in response to Democratic complaints that too many hearings for key nominees were planned for that day. Senate aides confirmed that the confirmation hearings for Education secretary nominee Betsy DeVos will now take place next week and the hearings for CIA director nominee Rep Mike Pompeo, R-Kansas will take place this Thursday. Democrats were concerned senators and the public would not be able to digest the testimony for the six hearings that were planned for Wednesday, which is also the day Trump is doing his first news conference in several months to talk about how he is separating himself from his business interests. The Wednesday hearings are now pared down to four: Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson will appear before the Foreign Relations Committee, the second day of testimony before the Judiciary Committee for the confirmation of Attorney General nominee Sen. Jeff Sessions, of Alabama; the second day of testimony as well for retired Gen. John Kelly, Trump's choice to head the Department of Homeland Security; and a hearing before the Senate transportation committee for Elaine Chao to be secretary of transportation. Party leaders in recent days have conducted intensive negotiations over the schedules for the hearings. Democrats also have been upset that all of Trump's picks haven't turned over all their background information, including ethics agreements with the government to ensure they avoid financial conflicts of interest in their new posts. Republicans have agreed to the changes in part because they are hoping to confirm multiple cabinet nominees in the hours after Trump is sworn-in January 20. Democrats have said they are likely to be more cooperative on that front -- and not employ procedural delaying tactics -- if Republicans meet their wishes on the schedules for hearings. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer of New York praised the changed schedule in a statement Tuesday. "We've gone from six hearings to three on Wednesday, and that's good progress," Schumer said. "This is a good first step but there is more road to travel." "We've gone from six hearings to three on Wednesday, and that's good progress," Schumer said. "This is a good first step but there is more road to travel." ©Classified documents presented last week to President Obama and President-elect Trump included allegations that Russian operatives claim to have compromising personal and financial information about Mr. Trump, multiple US officials with direct knowledge of the briefings tell CNN. The allegations were presented in a two-page synopsis that was appended to a report on Russian interference in the 2016 election. The allegations came, in part, from memos compiled by a former British intelligence operative, whose past work US intelligence officials consider credible. The FBI is investigating the credibility and accuracy of these allegations, which are based primarily on information from Russian sources, but has not confirmed many essential details in the memos about Mr. Trump. The classified briefings last week were presented by four of the senior-most US intelligence chiefs -- Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, FBI Director James Comey, CIA Director John Brennan, and NSA Director Admiral Mike Rogers. One reason the nation's intelligence chiefs took the extraordinary step of including the synopsis in the briefing documents was to make the President-elect aware that such allegations involving him are circulating among intelligence agencies, senior members of Congress and other government officials in Washington, multiple sources tell CNN. These senior intelligence officials also included the synopsis to demonstrate that Russia had compiled information potentially harmful to both political parties, but only released information damaging to Hillary Clinton and Democrats. This synopsis was not an official part of the report from the intelligence community case about Russian hacks, but some officials said it augmented the evidence that Moscow intended to harm Clinton's candidacy and help Trump's, several officials with knowledge of the briefings tell CNN. The two-page synopsis also included allegations that there was a continuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government, according to two national security officials. Sources tell CNN that these same allegations about communications between the Trump campaign and the Russians, mentioned in classified briefings for congressional leaders last year, CNN has confirmed that the synopsis was included in the documents that were presented to Mr. Trump but cannot confirm if it was discussed in his meeting with the intelligence chiefs. The Trump transition team declined repeated requests for comment. Appearing on Late Night with Seth Meyers, Kellyanne Conway, a senior Trump adviser, dismissed the memos, as unverified and untrue. CNN has reviewed a 35-page compilation of the memos, from which the two-page synopsis was drawn. The memos have Some of the memos were circulating as far back as last summer. What has changed since then is that US intelligence agencies have now checked out the former British intelligence operative and his vast network throughout Europe and find him and his sources to be credible enough to include some of the information in the presentations to the President and President-elect a few days ago. On the same day that the President-elect was briefed by the intelligence community, the top four Congressional leaders, and chairmen and ranking members of the House and Senate intelligence committees -- the so-called "Gang of Eight" -- were also provided a summary of the memos regarding Mr. Trump, according to law enforcement, intelligence and administration sources. The two-page summary was written without the detailed specifics and information about sources and methods included in the memos by the former British intelligence official. That said, the synopsis was considered so sensitive it was not included in the classified report about Russian hacking that was more widely distributed, but rather in an annex only shared at the most senior levels of the government: President Obama, the President-elect, and the eight Congressional leaders. CNN has also learned that on December 9, Senator John McCain gave a full copy of the memos -- dated from June through December, 2016 -- to FBI Director James Comey. McCain became aware of the memos from a former British diplomat who had been posted in Moscow. But the FBI had already been given a set of the memos compiled up to August 2016, when the former MI6 agent presented them to an FBI official in Rome, according to national security officials. The raw memos on which the synopsis is based were prepared by the former MI6 agent, who was posted in Russia in the 1990s and now runs a private intelligence gathering firm. His investigations related to Mr. Trump were initially funded by groups and donors supporting Republican opponents of Mr. Trump during the GOP primaries, multiple sources confirmed to CNN. Those sources also said that once Mr. Trump became the nominee, further investigation was funded by groups and donors supporting Hillary Clinton. Spokespeople for the FBI and the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment. Officials who spoke to CNN declined to do so on the record given the classified nature of the material. Some of the allegations One high level administration official told CNN, "I have a sense the outgoing administration and intelligence community is setting down the pieces so this must be investigated seriously and run down. I think [the] concern was to be sure that whatever information was out there is put into the system so it is evaluated as it should be and acted upon as necessary."

Classified documents presented last week to Trump and President Barack Obama included allegations that Russian operatives claim to have compromising personal and financial information about Mr. Trump, according to multiple US officials with direct knowledge of the briefings. Sources tell CNN that these same allegations about communications between the Trump campaign and the Russians, mentioned in classified briefings for congressional leaders last year, prompted then-Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid to send a letter to FBI Director James Comey in October, in which he claimed Comey had "explosive information" about the relationship. Reid took something of a victory lap on Tuesday. "Sen. Reid's letters and statements speak for themselves," a Reid spokesman, Adam Jentleson, said Tuesday, re-sharing that October letter. The news emerged late into attorney general nominee Jeff Sessions' first day of questions from the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is considering his appointment. Sessions told Democratic Sen. Al Franken, who appeared to be breaking the news to Sessions, that he was "not aware" of any communication between the Russian government and Trump affiliates during the course of the campaign, and seemed to dismiss the new allegations. "Allegations get made about candidates all the time and they've been made about President-elect Trump a lot sometimes. Some of them, virtually all of them have been proven to be exaggerated or untrue," Sessions said. "I would just say to you that I have no information about this matter." Chris Coons, a Democrat also on the committee, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on "The Situation Room" on Tuesday the allegations would be "explosive" and "truly shocking" if true, which he could not independently verify. And Chuck Grassley, the committee's chair, told CNN's Manu Raju following the hearing that if the allegations are true, then intensifying sanctions against Russia is "the best thing we can do."

Comey's refusal to comment during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing drew a perplexed response from Sen. Angus King, who noted the "irony" of Comey's lack of comment given that he shook the 2016 campaign by telling Congress the FBI was reviewing emails thought to be related to Hillary Clinton's private server. "You didn't say one way or another whether even there was an investigation underway?" King, a Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats, asked Comey. Comey responded, "Correct. I don't, especially in a public forum, we never confirm or deny a pending investigation." "The irony of your making that statement here I cannot avoid," King said. After the hearing, Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, tweeted: "Director Comey refused to answer my question about whether the FBI has investigated Trump campaign contacts with Russia." Less than two weeks before Election Day, Comey notified Congress that the FBI was reviewing emails later revealed to be related to the bureau's investigation into Anthony Weiner's sexting. Then, two days before the election, he later told Congress the FBI had not found anything new to change its recommendation that Clinton not be charged in the matter. Some members of the Clinton team, The FBI has previously looked into alleged ties between Russia and Trump's campaign. The FBI opened an investigation that involved former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort and his firm's ties to the ousted, pro-Russian president of Ukraine, CNN's Evan Perez During his testimony at Tuesday's hearing, the FBI director did say he believed Russia had attempted to hack multiple Republican targets. The FBI joined a report from the intelligence community last week accusing the Russian government of being behind several hacks related to the election, including stealing Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta's emails and providing them to WikiLeaks for public consumption. The report accused Russia doing this to hurt Clinton and help Trump. Russia has denied involvement in the hacks and dismissed the public version of the report, as has WikiLeaks.

Jeff Sessions faced hours of questioning from some of his closest colleagues on Tuesday, as he defended himself, his record and the President-elect who nominated him on fronts including racism allegations and torture. During the wide-ranging Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Democrats waged several fronts against Sessions, trying to trip him up, peg him into promises and to make clear positions from Donald Trump that concern them. Sessions maintained his cool throughout the grilling, repeatedly speaking about how "painful" past allegations of racism have been and defending his record. Hours earlier, as the hearing began, Sessions didn't wait for his record on race to be brought up before addressing it, diverging from his prepared statement to address "head on" the very allegations that helped sink his nomination for a judgeship in 1986. "I abhor the Klan and its hateful ideology," Sessions said. He also pledged to recuse himself from all investigations involving Hillary Clinton -- citing inflammatory comments he made during a "contentious" campaign season -- and said he would respect Supreme Court rulings and US law on issues including abortion, torture and same-sex marriage even if he does not agree with them. Sessions will likely be confirmed. Republicans hold a majority in the Senate and no GOP senators have spoken out against the' nomination. Instead, Democrats could only hope to trip Sessions up while making their case to the American people against the Trump administration. In one of the more memorable moments, the Alabama senator, who was one of Trump's earliest defenders on the campaign trail, was also asked about Trump's comments caught on a hot mic bragging about aggressive sexual behavior. "Is grabbing a woman by her genitals without consent, is that sexual assault?" asked Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy. "Yes," Sessions said. Sessions had been previously quoted in the immediate aftermath of the tape questioning the contents of the tape, in which Trump bragged about being able to grab women by the genitals with impunity, as sexual assault. He made clear he had not intended to make that suggestion. Many senators acknowledged the awkwardness of the situation, given that Sessions has long served in the Senate and on the very committee interrogating him. Democrat Richard Blumenthal noted Session is a "friend," before saying he still intended to be tough. Democrats pressed Sessions on uncomfortable topics but there were no fireworks. Firebrand Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz said he had been concerned the hearing would get "ugly" but praised his Democratic colleagues for being "largely restrained from going down that road." Sessions was introduced by two fellow GOP senators, fellow Alabama Sen. Richard Shelby and moderate Maine Sen. Susan Collins. Collins gave a vigorous defense of her colleague, though she noted she has not always agreed with the firebrand as a more moderate member of her party. "I have never witnessed anything to suggest that Senator Sessions is anything but a dedicated public servant and decent man," Collins said, directly addressing Sessions' 1986 judicial nomination. She noted that years later, Sen. Arlen Specter, who switched his affiliation from Republican to Democrat, singled out his vote against Sessions as the vote he regretted. "'I have since found Sen. Sessions is egalitarian,'" she quoted Specter in saying in 2009. Protesters began interrupting the event before the hearing began, and continued throughout the moment. Right as Sessions was walking in, two demonstrators apparently dressed as members of the Ku Klux Klan were escorted out of the room. During one of his introductions, a woman protesting with Code Pink was escorted out calling Sessions "evil," and two more separate protests were taken out during his opening statements, including a man yelling that Sessions is "racist." The protests continued sporadically throughout the testimony, each time being cleared quickly while the senators calmly waited. Sessions' hearing will continue into Wednesday, when Democrats will call several witnesses to testify against him, including members of the Congressional Black Caucus, and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who will become the first sitting senator to testify against confirmation of a fellow member. Other witnesses include former Justice officials and law enforcement representatives who will support Sessions, as well as officials from the American Civil Liberties Union and NAACP, who will oppose him. Sen. Al Franken asked in the early evening about "I'm not aware of any of those activities," Sessions said. "I have been called a surrogate at a time or two during the campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians and I'm unable to comment on it. Franken followed up, asking if Sessions knows "what compromising personal and financial information the Russians claim to have." "Sen. Franken, allegations get made about candidates all the time and they've been made about President-elect Trump a lot sometimes," Sessions said. "Some of them, virtually all of them have been proven to be exaggerated or untrue. I would just say to you that I have no information about this matter. I have not been in on the classified briefings and I'm not a member of the intelligence committee so I'm just not able to give you any comment on it at this time. The issue of civil rights came up repeatedly throughout the hearing, both from Democrats trying to box in Sessions' positions and Republicans trying to give Sessions an opportunity to clear his record. Sessions said he was keenly aware of civil rights and their importance. "I deeply understand the history of civil rights and the horrendous impact that relentless and systemic discrimination and the denial of voting rights has had on our African-American brothers and sisters," Sessions said. "I have witnessed it. We must continue to move forward and never back. I understand the demands for justice and fairness made by our LGBT community. I will ensure that the statutes protecting their civil rights and their safety are full enforced. I understand the lifelong scars born by women who are victims of assault and abuse." Sessions "It is a fundamental civil right to be safe in your home and your community," he said. Sessions' comments came during the first of several blockbuster confirmation hearings that will play out on Capitol Hill over the coming weeks as senators consider Trump's Cabinet picks. Through the hearing, Democrats laid down several markers for Sessions. Addressing the idea of prosecuting Clinton, a theme of Trump's campaign, Sessions said he wouldn't be involved. "I believe the proper thing for me to do would be to recuse myself from questions involving those kinds of investigations involving Secretary Clinton that were raised during the campaign and could be otherwise connected to it," Sessions said, upon questioning by Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley. "I believe that would be best for the country because we can never have a political dispute turn into a criminal dispute," Sessions said. He also denied participating in the "Lock her up" chants during the campaign heard at Trump rallies. "No I did not, I don't think. I heard it ... sometimes humorously done," he said. Sessions said he would respect the 1973 Supreme Court decision allowing abortion and the more recent Supreme Court decision allowing same-sex marriage -- even if he doesn't agree with the court's decisions. "I believe it violated the Constitution," Sessions said in response to a question from Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein about whether he stands by his past statements calling "It is the law of the land, it has been settled for some time. ... I will respect it and follow it," Sessions said. Likewise, Sessions said same-sex marriage is settled. "The Supreme Court has ruled on that, the dissents dissented vigorously, but it was 5-4 and ... I will follow that decision," he said. Sessions also faced a series of questions on the issue of torture and waterboarding, a hot topic since Trump has spoken in favor of the practice. Waterboarding is considered torture by US and international law, though Trump has said he feels it can be brought back into use in the field. Sessions emphasized that Congress has outlawed since it was used in the George W. Bush administration during the war on terror. "Congress has taken an action now that makes it absolutely improper and illegal to use waterboarding or any other form of torture in the United States by our military and by all our other departments and agencies," he said. Sessions has come under fire for his support of hard-line immigration policies also embraced by Trump, and deferred on a question as to whether he agrees with past statements from Trump calling for a complete ban on foreign Muslims from entering the United States -- saying that Trump has since moved away from that position. "I believe the President-elect has subsequent to that statement made clear that he believes the focus should be on individuals coming from countries that have histories of terrorism, and he's also stated that his policy and what he'd suggest is strong vetting," Sessions said in response to questioning from Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy about whether he supports denying entry to the US based on religion. Leahy asked why Sessions then voted against a sense of the Senate resolution that opposed using religion as a basis for denying entry into the US. "Many people do have religious views that are inimical to the values of the United States," Sessions said, saying he opposed the resolution because it barred considering religion at all. "I have no belief and do not support the idea that Muslims as a religious group should be denied admission to the United States. We have great Muslim citizens who have contributed in so many ways," Sessions said. "Americans are great believers in religious freedom and the right to exercise their religious beliefs." Sessions dodged taking a position on the intelligence community's conclusion that Russians engaged in hacking and other activities to interfere with the US election. Under questioning from outspoken Russia critic Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, Sessions said he needed to be briefed on the matter but had no reason to doubt the conclusions of the FBI. Sessions was also asked about Trump's statements off the campaign trail -- a 2005 tape that surfaced during the campaign that captured Trump on a hot mic bragging about aggressive sexual behavior, including using fame to grab women by their genitals with impunity. After the "Access Hollywood" tape surfaced, Sessions told a reporter that he didn't believe doing so was sexual assault, a position he later walked back. Leahy asked Sessions point blank: "Is grabbing a woman by her genitals without her consent, is that sexual assault?" "Clearly it would be," Sessions said. Leahy asked if Sessions would prosecute a "sitting president" or other high-level elected official if they were accused of the behavior that Trump described in the tape. "The President is subject to certain lawful restrictions and they would be required to be applied by the appropriate law enforcement official if appropriate, yes," Sessions said. Leahy asked again whether the conduct in the tape would be considered sexual assault. "The confusion about the question was a hypothetical question, and it related to what was said on the tape," Sessions said in defense. "I did not remember at the time whether this was suggested to be an unaccepted, unwanted type, which certainly would meet the definition." "Is grabbing a woman by her genitals without consent, is that sexual assault?" Leahy asked again. "Yes," Sessions said. One of the tensest moments questioning Sessions' record came from Franken, who was the first on the committee to raise concerns about Sessions' questionnaire that he submitted to the committee ahead of the hearing -- a key piece of Democrats' messaging against Sessions in the lead-up to the hearing. Franken zeroed in on two issues: a past statement in which Sessions said he "filed 20 or 30 cases" on desegregation and three of four civil rights cases he highlighted to the committee as being "personally" involved in. Under questioning, Sessions admitted to Franken that the "20 to 30" estimate from 2009 was not accurate. Franken also noted on the civil rights cases Sessions listed in his questionnaire as being part of the 10 most significant pieces of litigation he "personally handled," as the question from the committee asked, lawyers involved in those cases say Sessions was not involved. "We worked in the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, which brought those lawsuits; we handled three of the four ourselves," wrote three of the lawyers in a All three, J. Gerald Hebert, Joseph D. Rich and William Yeomans, have Democratic or left-leaning affiliations, and Republicans including Cruz later noted that Hebert opposed Sessions in 1986 and recanted a select portion of his testimony during that hearing. "We decided that was an appropriate response since it was a major historic cases in my office," Sessions said of filling out the questionnaire, saying he provided support to the case as attorney general. "It was 30 years ago, and my memory in these cases, I was supportive." "To me as a layman, it sounds to me like 'filed' means, 'I led the case,' or, 'I supervised the case,' it doesn't mean that 'my name was on it,'" Franken said. "Setting aside any political or ideological differences that you or I may have, DOJ is facing significant challenges ... and our country needs an attorney general who doesn't misrepresent or inflate their involvement on any single issue, so I consider this serious stuff." "To me as a layman, it sounds to me like 'filed' means, 'I led the case,' or, 'I supervised the case,' it doesn't mean that 'my name was on it,'" Franken said. "Setting aside any political or ideological differences that you or I may have, DOJ is facing significant challenges ... and our country needs an attorney general who doesn't misrepresent or inflate their involvement on any single issue, so I consider this serious stuff." ©Sen. Jeff Sessions -- President-elect Donald Trump's pick for attorney general -- denied "damnably false charges" of racism Tuesday as he kicked off his hours-long confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Sessions also said he'd play no role in considering prosecuting Hillary Clinton, opposed a ban on Muslims entering the United States and said he wouldn't challenge existing Supreme Court decisions on abortion and same-sex marriage. Here's some of what we've learned so far from Nowhere in Sessions' prepared remarks was a rebuttal of the accusations that sank his 1986 nomination for a federal judgeship. But he decided to address them "head on" anyway, denying decades-old claims that he had offered supportive words about the Ku Klux Klan and criticized the NAACP. He said those were "damnably false charges." "I abhor the Klan and its hateful ideology," Sessions said. "I never declared the NAACP was un-American." The Alabama senator and former US attorney told senators that in 1986, "there was an effort to caricaturize me as something I wasn't." As he discussed those allegations of racism, his wife, Mary Sessions, became emotional in the crowd. Sessions said he'd seen the horrors of racism "as a Southerner." "I know that was wrong, and I know we need to do better. We can never go back," he said. "I am totally committed to maintaining the freedom and equality this country has to provide to every citizen and I can assure you that's how I will approach it." Sessions backed away from Trump's campaign trail promise to ban all Muslims from entering the United States. "I have no belief and do not support the idea that Muslims as a religious group should be denied admission to the United States," the Alabama senator said. He did, though, open the door for religion to be used as a factor in approving visas. Under questioning from Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, Sessions said some people hold religious views that are "inimical" to the safety of people in the United States. Sessions also defended Trump, noting that he has backed away from his calls for an outright Muslim ban, instead aiming that ban at countries with terrorist activity. "Lock her up" chants rang through nearly every Trump campaign rally this fall. Trump once promised to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate his Democratic rival. If any of that happens, though, Sessions says he'll have nothing to do with it. He said he'd recuse himself, citing his role as a prominent Trump supporter during the 2016 presidential race. "I believe the proper thing for me to do would be to recuse myself from questions involving those kinds of investigations involving Secretary Clinton that were raised during the campaign and could be otherwise connected to it," Sessions said, upon questioning by Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley. "I believe that would be best for the country because we can never have a political dispute turn into a criminal dispute." "I believe it violated the Constitution," Sessions said in response to a question from Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein about whether he stands by his past statements calling Roe a "colossal" mistake. "It is the law of the land, it has been settled for some time. ... I will respect it and follow it," Sessions said. Likewise, Sessions said same-sex marriage is settled. "The Supreme Court has ruled on that, the dissents dissented vigorously, but it was 5-4 and ... I will follow that decision," he said. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, wasn't willing to let Sessions dodge one of the biggest controversies Trump faced during the election: the "Access Hollywood" tape in which he bragged about sexually assaulting women. "Is grabbing a woman by her genitals without her consent sexual assault?" Leahy asked. Sessions responded, "Clearly it would be." Sessions was pressed on waterboarding -- which Trump has spoken in favor of bringing back even though the practice is considered torture under US and international law and is illegal. Pressed by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island, on whether waterboarding is torture, Sessions replied that Congress has, since waterboarding's use in the early Bush administration during the war on terror, outlawed it. "Congress has taken an action now that makes it absolutely improper and illegal to use waterboarding or any other form of torture in the United States by our military and by all our other departments and agencies," he said. Sessions was also grilled by Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut, on the Constitution's "emoluments" clause, which bans foreign business dealings by officers of the United States -- but might not actually apply to presidents. The Alabama senator sidestepped the question, avoiding Blumenthal's urging to appoint a special counsel if Trump or a member of his family ran afoul of the law and saying he'd have to look into it.

Jeff Sessions indicated at his confirmation hearing Tuesday that as attorney general, he might break the federal government's truce with states on marijuana. During President Barack Obama's administration, states have been allowed to "experiment" with legalizing pot, and the Justice Department, under Attorneys General Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch, has allowed many legal operations to continue without laying down the full weight of federal law against them. But asked by Utah Sen. Mike Lee on Tuesday if the federal government would continue to look the other way while states enacted their own laws regarding marijuana, Sessions said he wouldn't commit to not enforcing existing federal law. "It's not so much the attorney general's job to decide what laws to enforce. We should do our job and enforce laws as effectively as we're able," said Sessions, adding that Congress was entitled to change federal law if it so desired. Still, the Marijuana Policy Project, which aims to allow states to determine their own marijuana laws, was encouraged by Sessions' comments. "It is notable that Sen. Sessions chose not to commit to vigorously enforcing federal prohibition laws in states that have reformed their marijuana laws," the group said in a statement. "He also recognized that enforcing federal marijuana laws would be dependent upon the availability of resources, the scarcity of which poses a problem. He was given the opportunity to take an extreme prohibitionist approach and he passed on it." The federal government calls pot a Schedule I narcotic -- of no medical value and in the same class as heroin. But in recent years, several states and the nation's capital have made pot a legal prescription drug or an outright legal recreational product on par with alcohol. Sessions himself is no fan of marijuana, telling Sessions' comments on Tuesday may have marked a break with President-elect Donald Trump. In an appearance Sessions' comments on Tuesday may have marked a break with President-elect Donald Trump. In an appearance ©Sen. Jeff Sessions, in the middle of his confirmation hearing to become President-elect Donald Trump's attorney general, said Tuesday he would respect laws allowing abortion despite his deeply held personal belief that the courts are wrong on the issue. The Alabama Republican said specifically that he would respect the Supreme Court's decision in Sessions, who has consistently voted against abortion rights in the Senate and has a 0% rating from several abortion rights groups, told senators overseeing his committee hearing that although he believed "It is the law of the land, it has been settled for some time," Sessions said. "I will respect it and follow it." Sessions said, however, that he believes the decision was a "colossal" mistake by the Supreme Court. Dawn Laguens, the executive director of Planned Parenthood, suggested in a statement that Sessions' comments didn't change her organization's opposition to his nomination. "The attorney general plays the critical role of the nation's chief law enforcement officer of the United States, and Sen. Sessions has failed to demonstrate that he will work to keep the country safe, protect the right to vote for all citizens, and protect health care providers," Laguens said. "We urge the Judiciary Committee to question Sen. Sessions on this troubling history." Trump agrees with Session's personal beliefs on abortion and has said he plans to nominate justices who want to reverse "I'm pro-life. The judges will be pro-life," Trump said in a post-election interview with CBS, arguing that if the Supreme Court overturned ©Gen. John Kelly, Donald Trump's pick to lead the Department of Homeland Security, broke with a slew of the President-elect's most controversial campaign proposals during his Senate confirmation hearing Tuesday. And while Kelly could oversee many of Trump's most divisive proposals like mass deportations and tighter controls on Muslim immigration should Trump follow through, the confirmation hearing remained largely non-confrontational. The "lovefest," as Democrat Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota described it, appears to have set the retired Marine Corps general on a glide path to confirmation. Before the hearing even wrapped, Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri, the top Democrat on the homeland security committee, took to Twitter to proclaim Kelly a "good choice for Secretary of Homeland Security." "I believe him when he says he 'will speak truth to power.' Good answers," she tweeted. Several of Kelly's answers involved demonstrating that he was opposed to several of Trump's most vitriolic campaign rhetoric and controversial proposals. Kelly said he would "absolutely" abide by US laws prohibiting the use of waterboarding and other forms of torture, breaking with Trump's campaign promise to bring back waterboarding and "worse" forms of torture in the fight against terrorism. "I don't think we should ever come close to crossing a line that is beyond what we as Americans would expect to follow in terms of interrogation techniques," he said, agreeing that the Geneva Conventions should continue to serve as a guide for the US. Kelly, the former commander of US Southern Command, also downplayed the importance of one of Trump's central campaign promises: building a wall on the US-Mexico border. "A physical barrier in and of itself will not do the job. It has to be a layered defense," Kelly said, stressing the need to build partnerships with Latin American countries to combat drug and human trafficking. And Kelly also agreed that several of Trump's campaign proposals targeted at Muslims would likely be unconstitutional and said he disagreed with the idea of targeting individuals on the sole basis of their religion. Under questioning from Sen. Gary Peters, D-Michigan, Kelly agreed conducting surveillance of US mosques and creating a database of Muslims in the US raised constitutional issues. "I don't think it's ever appropriate to focus on something like religion as the only factor (in counterterrorism)," Kelly said. "I don't agree with registering people based on ethnic or religion." Kelly was also pressed by Sen. Kamala Harris, D-California, on deportation priorities under a Trump administration, expressing the concern and fears that undocumented immigrants who were brought to the US as children feel. Kelly declined to elaborate on his priorities for deportation, but said law-abiding undocumented immigrants would "probably not be at the top of the list" and said "the law will guide me." He noted that the incoming administration's immigration policies have not yet been set and said he has not been involved in those discussions. Kelly also addressed the issue of data collection several times during the hearing and said he is opposed to the "mass collection of data on people." Kelly would oversee the implementation of many of Trump's controversial proposals should he be confirmed to lead the Department of Homeland Security, and his answers on torture and Muslim-targeted counterterrorism programs appeared to give Democrats confidence that Kelly would be a voice of reason in a Trump administration should be confirmed. Trump's pick for attorney general, Jeff Sessions, also said Tuesday that waterboarding is torture -- and called it illegal. "Congress has taken an action now that makes it absolutely improper and illegal to use waterboarding or any other form of torture in the United States by our military and by all our other departments and agencies," he said during his own confirmation hearing. Kelly's selection was expected to be devoid of fireworks as Kelly's selection was met with early signs of approval by several Democrats on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. Then, Sen. Tom Carper, the outgoing top Democrat on the committee, introduced Kelly before the committee as an "exceptionally well-qualified" leader and urged his confirmation, as did Republican Sen. John McCain, a fellow veteran, and former Defense Secretary Robert Gates. Still, Kelly sought to guard himself against questions about Trump's campaign proposals and rhetoric at the outset of the hearing. "I believe in America and the principles upon which our country and way of life are guaranteed. I believe in respect, tolerance and diversity of opinion. I have a profound respect for the law and will always strive to uphold it," Kelly said in his opening statement. "I have never had a problem speaking truth to power, and I firmly believe that those in power deserve full candor and my honest assessment and recommendations." Trump's pledge to build a wall on the US border with Mexico; his calls to deport millions of undocumented immigrants living in the US; and his proposal to ban Muslims from the US -- which he has not disavowed -- and conduct extreme vetting of immigrants from Muslim-majority countries would all fall within DHS's purview. The department oversees a slew of key US agencies including US Customs and Border Protection, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, and the Transportation Security Administration. And Trump's vitriolic rhetoric branding undocumented Mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists and his comments about Muslims could also haunt Kelly's hearing. "DHS is an area where the President-elect has made a variety of comments both through the campaign and subsequently after the election and you know I think you'll get a number of questions related to those comments and how they pair with Gen. Kelly's philosophy and strategy," Drew Pusateri, communications director for the committee's top Democratic member, Sen. Claire McCaskill, said Tuesday previewing the hearing. "These kinds of issues will come up." Kelly sought to stress that the US is a "nation of laws" and that he believes in enforcing those laws should he be pressed on Trump's controversial immigration proposals. But even as Pusateri noted that Kelly would likely face questions about Trump's most controversial proposals and rhetoric, he noted Kelly's "long history of service to the US" and said McCaskill is familiar with his qualifications stemming from her time on the Senate Armed Services Committee. Several other Democratic senators on the committee may also be more focused on the US' northern border, rather than its southern border with Mexico which has been the source of much of Trump's controversial statements. Four of the seven Democrats on the committee hail from states that share a border with Canada. An aide to Sen. Jon Tester of Montana noted that the state has a 540-mile border with Canada and said Tester would focus his questioning on northern border issues. Tester plans to ask Kelly about combating visa overstays, the aide said. While Tester has not yet decided whether he will vote to confirm Kelly, the aide noted that Tester walked away very impressed after the two met privately. Kelly's designation for the Cabinet post was also met with warm words by several Democrats on the committee, including Carper. The Delaware Democrat called Kelly his "friend" and "a man of steady leadership who has years of experience working with our neighbors in Latin America as commander of US Southern Command." Kelly appeared before the Committee on Monday a month after Trump tapped him for the top homeland security post, time he's spent preparing for the hearing including by sitting for a mock confirmation hearing with Trump transition staff. Kelly was joined at his confirmation hearing by his wife, daughter and son-in-law, a disabled veteran and amputee.

The event brought the current National Security Adviser Susan Rice and her replacement, retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, together on the same stage, where they each gave a short speech on the critical importance of the orderly transition process and avoided the thorny issues that separate the two administrations' foreign policy outlooks. Flynn, who served as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency under President Barack Obama before he was fired and became one of President-elect Donald Trump's most vocal supporters, complimented Rice on her speech and offered effusive praise for Madeleine Albright, who served as secretary of state under former President Bill Clinton. "What I would like to do is just take a brief pause because I am in awe of Secretary Albright, who's sitting here in front today," said Flynn, "and I'd like everybody to just give her a big round of applause for her dignity." In his speech, Flynn focused on the broad theme of American exceptionalism and the notion that the United States is the "indispensable nation" -- a phrase widely attributed to Albright. "This is the essence of American leadership," he said. "Whether we like it or not, the world needs us." Other speakers at Tuesday's conference included Secretary of State John Kerry, who offered a warning of sorts to the incoming administration, making a veiled reference to the President-elect's prolific use of Twitter. "If policy is going to be made in 140 characters on Twitter," said Kerry, "and every reasonable measurement of accountability is being bypassed, and people don't care about it, we have a problem."

His voice at moments catching with emotion, Obama recounted a presidency that saw setbacks as well as successes. Admitting candidly that political discourse has soured under his watch, Obama demanded that Americans renew efforts at reconciliation. "It falls to each of us to be those anxious, jealous guardians of our democracy," the President said. "To embrace the joyous task we've been given to continually try to improve this great nation of ours." Obama also stressed solidarity despite a presidency sometimes at odds with Congress. "Democracy does not require uniformity," Obama said. "Our founders quarreled and compromised, and expected us to do the same. But they knew that democracy does require a basic sense of solidarity -- the idea that for all our outward differences, we are all in this together; that we rise or fall as one." In a concession that, for now, his brand of progressive politics is stalled in Washington, Obama admitted "for every two steps forward, it often feels we take one step back." He implored his backers to be vigilant in protecting basic American values he warned could come under siege. "Democracy can buckle when we give in to fear," he said. "So just as we, as citizens, must remain vigilant against external aggression, we must guard against a weakening of the values that make us who we are." And he warned against turning inward, telling Democrats that only by involving themselves in a real political discourse could they hope to renew the hopeful vision he brought to the White House eight years ago. "After eight years as your President, I still believe that," he went on. "And it's not just my belief. It's the beating heart of our American idea -- our bold experiment in self-government." Obama's speech is the capstone of a months-long farewell tour, manifested in extended magazine interviews, lengthy television sit-downs, and the White House's own efforts to document the President's waning administration. Through it all, Obama has sought to highlight the achievements of his presidency using statistics showing the country better off now than eight years ago. As he spoke before a rowdy crowd of supporters, Obama was interrupted often with screams of "I Love you Obama." When a protester holding a "Pardon All of Us" sign, chants of "four more years" drowned out the shouts. Obama sought to corral his crowd, listing the accomplishments of the last eight years ranging from health care to marriage equality, all while insisting that his work isn't finished. He recognized his successor Donald Trump, saying he was committed to a peaceful transition of power. But he warned that going forward Democrats shouldn't fall in line with their commander-in-chief. Obama, who has addressed race with varying degrees of force during his time in office, used his farewell to insist Americans work harder to understand each other's struggles. After presiding over eight years that saw race relations enter a fraught new era, Obama demanded that differences be identified and reconciled. "Brown kids will represent a larger share of America's workforce" in the years ahead, Obama proclaimed, calling for better rules that will help the children of immigrants succeed. He warned that "laws alone won't be enough" in resolving persistent differences between Americans. "Hearts must change," he said. He called on African-Americans and minorities to view with empathy "the middle-aged white man who from the outside may seem like he's got all the advantages, but who's seen his world upended by economic, cultural, and technological change." And he urged whites to regard the protests of minorities as a fight "not demanding special treatment, but the equal treatment our Founders promised." "Regardless of the station we occupy, we have to try harder," Obama said. "To start with the premise that each of our fellow citizens loves this country just as much as we do; that they value hard work and family like we do; that their children are just as curious and hopeful and worthy of love as our own." In coming to Chicago, Obama hoped to capitalize on a well of goodwill that's expanded in the final year of his tenure. He discarded the staid Oval Office or East Room for his last formal set of remarks, choosing instead the city where his political rise began and where he declared victory in 2008 and 2012. Inside a vast convention hall packed with more than 20,000 of his most ardent supporters and former staffers, the mood was wistful. Ahead of his address, aides described the normally unsentimental commander in chief as nostalgic. Over the past several weeks, Obama has offered a rational view of Trump's election and rarely let on to any apprehension about his future as an ex-president. First lady Michelle Obama has articulated a more candid view in a scaled-back version of her own farewell. She sat for an hour-long interview with Oprah Winfrey, frankly admitting that Democrats were now "feeling what not having hope feels like." And she became emotional during her final set of formal remarks at the White House Friday, her voice quaking and eyes welling with tears as she told a crowd of educators: "I hope I made you proud." During his speech Tuesday, Obama voice quaked when describing his wife's service. "You took on a role you didn't ask for and made it your own with grace and grit and style and good humor," he said. "You made the White House a place that belongs to everybody." The President had been planning his speech for months, aides said, formulating the broad themes while on vacation over the holidays in Hawaii and developing drafts starting last week. He told aides months ago that he preferred to deliver his farewell address in his hometown, a first for a departing President. George W. Bush, unpopular and facing a financial crisis, delivered his final prime-time address in the White House East Room to a crowd of 200 supporters and aides. Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter all used the Oval Office -- a setting Obama has long spurned for formal remarks. George H.W. Bush traveled outside of Washington to West Point for a departing address after failing to secure a second term, though he didn't actually bill it as a farewell. The tradition extends back to George Washington, who issued warnings against unchecked power and partisan entrenchment in a written address to the nation in 1796. Like major addresses in the past, Obama wrote his speech himself, dictating passages to his chief speechwriter Cody Keenan who puts the President's words into print. Obama returned the drafts with heavy annotations, writing his changes in a tightly compressed scrawl on the margins. The President and Keenan went through at least four drafts of the farewell speech, an official told CNN Tuesday. The broad themes of the speech came together while the President was in Hawaii and he started reading a first draft on the long flight home last Sunday. Aside from Keenan, several familiar names from the past were involved in the drafting, including former speechwriter Jon Favreau and former senior adviser David Axelrod. When he returns to Washington in the early morning hours of Wednesday, it will be Obama's 1,293rd -- and final -- flight aboard Air Force One. He'll use the presidential aircraft on Inauguration Day to depart Washington. But with only a former president aboard, it's known simply as a "Special Air Mission."

The 2005 "Access Hollywood" conversation, which leaked during the 2016 election, featured Trump making lewd and sexually aggressive remarks about women. In the recording, Trump said he could grab women "by the pussy" and that he would sometimes "just start kissing them." Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy asked Sessions about the conversation during the Alabama Republican's confirmation hearing and if he thought what Trump described amounted to sexual assault. "Is grabbing a woman by her genitals, without consent, is that sexual assault?" Leahy asked during the hearing. "Clearly, it would be," Sessions responded. "If a sitting President or any other high federal official was accused of committing what the President-elect described in a context in which it could be federally prosecuted, would you be able to prosecute and investigate?" Leahy asked Sessions. "The President is subject to certain lawful restrictions and they would be required to be applied by the appropriate law enforcement official if appropriate, yes," Sessions responded. Sessions grew increasingly agitated by the exchange, unable to directly say whether he would investigate and prosecute a federal official for similar remarks made by the President-elect. "My question is very simple: Is grabbing a woman by the genitals without her consent sexual assault?" Leahy asked. "Yes," Sessions responded. This was the first time that the leaked recording was brought up during the hearing.

But President-elect Donald Trump says any delay is unacceptable. Trump demanded Tuesday that his fellow Republicans act immediately to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. According to the Times, Trump said "he would not accept a delay of more than a few weeks before a replacement plan was voted on." Congressional Republicans, however, are nowhere close to proposing a plan to replace the sweeping healthcare law, let alone having something in place that can be voted on, withstand a Senate filibuster and be sent to the White House for Trump's signature. These comments from Trump could put Republican leaders in a bind, as they have already been fielding widespread concerns from rank-and-file members about moving too fast to dismantle Obamacare when there is little consensus on an alternative. Trump's interview also appears to suggest the incoming President's lack of understanding about the process that is already unfolding on Capitol Hill to repeal large parts of the law -- a first procedural vote is expected some time this week, but a final repeal bill was not expected to be voted on for weeks or months. The President-elect's direction to Republicans was published in the Times just hours after Ryan said that GOP leadership now hopes to tackle "repeal and replace" simultaneously -- a dramatic turn of events from the original goal of quickly repealing the healthcare law and then spending years standing up a new system. "It is our goal to bring it all together concurrently," Ryan told reporters after a closed-door meeting with House GOP members. Ryan emphasized that it would be a complicated and multi-pronged effort. "We'll use every tool at our disposal through legislation, through regulation, to bring replace concurrent along with repeal so we can save people from this mess," Ryan said. Republicans on Capitol Hill are united on getting rid of President Barack Obama's signature healthcare law. The House and Senate are expected to vote this week on a budget resolution -- dubbed by Republicans as the "repeal resolution" -- that will be the first of two steps in rolling back major parts of Obamacare. "He's saying we can't wait two years, we would all agree with that," said Rep. Chris Collins, R-New York, and a member of Trump's transition team, said of Trump's comments. "It's also, given this legislative body, not going to be in two weeks." Collins said Trump is a CEO and using that mindset to make a decision and wants Republicans in Congress to do the same. "That's where Donald Trump the CEO versus a legislative body that tends to procrastinate when they don't want make a decision will be butting heads some," he said. "He wants us moving it through so we can put it on his desk right away," Collins added. "I'm not reading it literally literally." Republicans came back to Washington with a plan to quickly repeal the law while working on a replacement, but as they confront the practical impact of wiping away much of the current health care system, Republicans are also anxious to quickly reassure the public that they have a plan for what would come in its place. With the budget resolution vote just days away, alarm bells are ringing out across Capitol Hill. Senate Republicans have grown increasingly vocal, airing concerns that the party may be moving too fast to repeal a law that covers some 20 million people; in the House, GOP members ranging from conservatives to moderates are also joining in. These worries spilled out into the open during a Tuesday morning House GOP conference meeting, where members shared their unease about the upcoming budget resolution vote. Rep. Mark Meadows, the chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said the group will not take an official position on the vote until they get more reassurances from leadership. "We just would like some more specifics in terms of repeal and replacement aspects of the Affordable Care Act, where we're going with it," Meadows said as he left the meeting. "Hopefully, what we will see and we're hopeful that leadership will give us some more specifics in the next 24 to 48 hours." "I ran for office on repeal and replace. I certainly think we should advance replacement aspects as quickly as possible," New Jersey Republican Rep. Leonard Lance told CNN. Lance said he was willing to support the procedural steps to begin unwinding the law but stressed that he wants a clear timeline for those covered under Obamcare's Medicaid expansion so patients know where to get coverage under a new program. Kentucky Rep. Andy Barr suggested that there were tensions in Tuesday's meeting between members who were emphatic that a repeal and replace vote happen simultaneously, and others who stressed that it's simply impossible to move toward repeal until the Republicans first pass the budget resolution. "There's some folks who have expressed a desire to do everything at once but I don't think they fully understand that if we don't take these first steps, we're never going to get to the next step," said Barr, a member of the Republican Study Committee, which introduced its own replacement plan last week. Barr said he will vote in support of the budget resolution and that he expects a "very large majority" of his conference to do the same. Ryan and other leaders discussed ideas for adding replacement into an upcoming budget reconciliation bill -- the vehicle through which Republicans plan to roll back Obamacare. But the speaker admitted that they haven't decided yet how much of the law they can dismantle or replace with this approach, pointing out that there are rules limiting what the budget reconciliation bill can include. "We will pass as much as we can through whatever vehicle we've got and then we will pass all the other things through regular order outside of reconciliation that show you the full scope of what a real replacement effort will look like," Ryan said. Florida GOP Rep. Dennis Ross told reporters that the hope is to "do as much replacement as we can get away with in the reconciliation package" before throwing the ball back to the Senate. He said Republicans will focus on measures related to tax and spending, including provisions to promote health savings accounts, remove the financial penalty for those who don't enroll in Obamacare. Republican leaders also continue to insist there will be a smooth transition to a new system and that they won't abruptly cancel insurance policies. House GOP Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers took those reassurances one step further on Tuesday, saying: "Let me be clear: no one who has coverage because of Obamacare today will lose that coverage." Others stressed the need to begin the process now to repeal the law, but seemed comfortable with allotting plenty of time for the rest of the process to play out. "There is a recognition that Obamacare took a long time to construct," Illinois Republican Rep. Peter Roskam said, "and it's similarly going to take a long time to deconstruct." Republicans working on the healthcare issue downplayed Trump's comments, which came after the closed-door conference meeting, pointing to the difference between the President-elect's perspective as a businessman rather than a political leader. "You can't repeal it and replace it quickly - that's an oxymoron," Collinstold reporters. "We can repeal it quickly and replace it in a timely fashion." Many House GOP members are reluctant to vote for the budget resolution on Friday until some of their questions about the plan ahead are cleared up. "We should not vote until we see the plans and well in front, plenty of time on what the fix is," House Rules Committee Chairman Pete Sessions said Tuesday. He said members are "entitled" to have details on the replacement "before we do anything." Sessions said GOP leaders still trying to figure out the next steps in terms of the budget vote slated for Friday. North Carolina Rep. Richard Hudson hadn't read the Times story, but he essentially agreed with Trump's message to proceed quickly. "I think that's where the American people are and we are working through the process," he said. "Does that means weeks or days, does it mean hours -- we are working through the timing." Asked if Trump doesn't understand the process, Hudson said, "the guy's not a politician, he's a businessman."

"That quote was so true of Mr. Trump: 'The media took him literally but not seriously and his supporters took him seriously but not literally,'" GOP Sen. Bill Cassidy told CNN. "I think he speaks in concepts, and I accept his concept. We need a sense of urgency." Trump's And the timeline Trump is advocating for is considered impossible -- a first procedural vote aimed at repealing Obamacare is slated for some time this week, but a final "repeal" legislation -- a budget reconciliation bill -- is not expected to be voted on for weeks or months. Republicans said Tuesday they took Trump's comments thematically, rather than literally. "He wants us moving it through so we can put it on his desk right away. I'm not reading it literally, literally," said Rep. Chris Collins of New York, New York congressman also noted that it's simply impossible to repeal and replace Obamacare quickly: "That's an oxymoron." North Carolina Rep. Richard Hudson said he agreed with Trump's message to proceed quickly. "Does that means weeks or days? Does it mean hours? We are working through the timing." Asked if Trump doesn't understand the process, Hudson simply responded: "The guy's not a politician, he's a businessman." The scramble to parse the President-elect's latest Obamacare remarks marked one more twist in what is already a chaotic week for Republicans, as they forge ahead with their top legislative priority of dismantling President Barack Obama's landmark healthcare law. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused to be pinned down by reporters at a news conference on a timeframe for a vote on the repeal bill or when the replacement measures would be approved. "We're working on what comes next," McConnell said. "As I said, we're going to be involved with the administration, the House and the Senate, in crafting a package that we can all agree on that will provide a smooth transition from the disaster we have now to what comes next." McConnell declined to provide any other specifics about timing or what would be in the replacement. "What I'm not going to do is negotiate with you the replacement," he told reporters. Similarly, the Senate's second-ranking Republican, Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, insisted that GOP leaders would not commit to any timeline other than: "ASAP, as soon as possible." Sen. Orrin Hatch, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, was asked if Trump's new timeframe could be met. Hatch responded that it was "possible," before amending: "It's probably going to be a little later." Asked about Trump's demand that a repeal vote happen as quickly as next week, GOP Sen. Susan Collins told CNN: "I don't see how we can have a replacement ready that quickly." "That would be very difficult to do," said Collins. "That would be very difficult to do," said Collins. ©Republicans are preparing to take a major vote this week aimed at repealing Obamacare -- but the drumbeat of concern within GOP ranks about the lack of a replacement is growing louder. The Senate is poised to vote on a budget resolution later this week, the first in a two-step process of rolling back major parts of the Affordable Care Act. At the same time, GOP lawmakers are speaking out with force, concerned about the political backlash if the GOP is perceived as being reckless given that 20 million Americans have health coverage through Obamacare and there's no clear vision or firm timeline for an alternative. These early concerns indicate swelling reservations over what's become known as the GOP's "repeal and delay" strategy -- voting on repeal but delaying the repeal from going into effect for several years, buying the party time to craft a replacement plan. Sen. Bob Corker warned fellow Republicans that it would be "problematic," "not very appealing" and "doesn't seem very intelligent" to repeal the law without a replacement. "To me, it's much more prudent to figure out where you're going to go from here, and attempt to do it all at the same time," the Tennessee Republican told CNN. "People will see some of the flaws in just repealing only." Sen. Rand Paul is emerging as one of the most vocal GOP opponents of voting on a repeal bill before coming up with a replacement package, as he argues that the two votes must happen simultaneously. "I will do everything in my power to have a vote on it the day we repeal Obamacare," Paul told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Monday, noting that Trump personally expressed his support for this approach in a phone call with the senator. The Kentucky senator is planning to unveil replacement legislation in the coming days. His spokesman separately told CNN that Paul plans to vote against the budget resolution this week over budgetary reasons, and wouldn't say whether Paul could vote against a reconciliation bill later this year that would carry the repeal language. Republicans are using a fast-track budget mechanism to repeal major portions of Obamacare in order get around a Democratic filibuster in the Senate. But they are keenly aware that passing any replacement package or series of smaller bills afterwards will require 60 votes in the Senate -- in other words, some Democratic support. Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson told CNN Monday: "I want to see the game plan in terms of how you actually enact replacement." "I take (Senate Minority Leader Chuck) Schumer at his word that if we just go ahead and repeal, Democrats won't provide one vote for enacting the replacement," he said. "So I think we need to actually have a game plan." Asked whether he might vote against the reconciliation bill that repeals Obamacare if there isn't a replacement plan by the time Congress takes it up, Johnson simply said: "That's hypothetical. I'm hoping we'll have one." Sen. John McCain, who previously suggested he would like his party to slow down on repeal efforts, demurred when asked Monday if he had concerns about a "repeal and delay" strategy. The Arizona senator said he "can't describe exactly how" the process would unfold, before settling on a simple declarative statement: "We will replace." One other potential sticking point is Planned Parenthood. House Speaker Paul Ryan last week announced that the party intends to use the budget reconciliation bill to strip all federal funding for the group. At least two pro-choice senators -- Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska -- Losing the support of this pair of GOP senators could be detrimental to the party's repeal efforts. Murkowski told CNN on Monday that she doesn't have reservations about voting for the budget resolution this week, but that the party must "figure out what everything looks like later on." "We are going to have plenty of time for lots of good conversations," the senator said when asked whether she has spoken with Senate leadership about her concerns. Senate leadership aides expect the chamber to vote on the budget resolution around Thursday. Once the resolution has been approved in the Senate, the House is expected to take it up right away -- possibly as early as Friday. A House GOP source said they expect the proceedings to approve the budget resolution in the House to be "straightforward." At this point, a number of congressional committees will start crafting a budget reconciliation bill -- legislation that that would repeal major parts of the Affordable Care Act. This bill would only require a simple majority in the Senate for passage, allowing Republicans to avoid a Democratic filibuster. Under pressure to make faster progress on a replacement plan, Senate Republicans are now It could be weeks -- possibly even months -- before the House and Senate vote on the legislation and send it to future-President Donald Trump to sign. Congress will then turn to the much more complicated task of replacing what they voted to roll back. Any replacement bill will need 60 votes in the Senate, which means Republicans will need to pick up support from at least eight Senate Democrats -- a tall order in the current partisan climate but possible through lengthy negotiations and compromise. Some moderate Democrats, including West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, have indicated that they are willing to work with colleagues across the aisle. GOP leaders have recently started to suggest that they want to pass incremental replacement bills rather than one comprehensive bill, calculating that it will be easier to garner bipartisan support for smaller replacement bills. "We're not going to do a comprehensive bill. We are going to do it in a step-by-step basis," Cornyn said last week. "We're not going to do a comprehensive bill. We are going to do it in a step-by-step basis," Cornyn said last week. ©President-elect Donald Trump told the New York Times he wants the Obamacare replacement to come simultaneously or soon after the repeal. But there are a few problems with that. To come up with a comprehensive replacement will take time. A long delay is not what Trump has in mind. The other alternative is to put some replacement elements in the repeal bill. It's a compromise, but there are only so many replacement items that can go into a repeal bill. In other words, the can gets kicked down the road. ©"They're going to have to get used to working for a new boss," Woolsey said. "He's the one who won the election.

"After I asked and ... demanded that we have a question, Sean Spicer, the incoming press secretary, did say to me that if I were to do that again I was going to be thrown out of this press conference," Acosta told CNN's Wolf Blitzer and Jake Tapper, speaking on "Inside Politics." Spicer's threat came after Acosta pressed Trump to take a follow-up question after the president-elect assailed CNN for publishing a report Tuesday night on classified documents presented to President Obama and Trump which included allegations that Russian operatives claimed to possess compromising personal and financial information about Trump. "Mr. President -elect since you are attacking our news organization can you give us a chance," asked Acosta. "Not you," interjected Trump."[Y]our organization is terrible ... I am not going to give you a question ... You are fake news." "Mr. President-elect that is not appropriate," Acosta chided towards the end of the exchange. Speaking later with Tapper and Blitzer, Acosta said he felt obligated to push Trump to answer a follow up question given the attack on CNN. "I felt it was only fair that if our news organization is going to be attacked that we get a chance to ask a follow up question about what Donald Trump was talking about," he said.

Al Franken signaled Wednesday that he is likely to vote against Donald Trump's nominee for attorney general, saying after the second day of hearings on Capitol Hill that Jeff Sessions had yet to allay his concerns. Franken, one of the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee that is overseeing Sessions' nomination, said he could not tell whether the panel would approve the controversial Alabama senator. Democrats have targeted his record on race and asked whether he would be strong enough to stand up to the President should he cross any legal lines. "I have a lot of skepticism about his ability to be the kind of attorney general who protects all Americans," Franken told CNN's Erin Burnett on "OutFront." "I don't think that he is necessarily the right choice to protect the rights of Americans." Franken specifically voiced concerns over Sessions' thoughts on the Voting Rights Act, which granted the federal government the power to intervene in a set of Southern states should their laws seem to disadvantage racial minorities. Much of the law was gutted by the Supreme Court in a 2013 decision. "I worry about him with the Voting Rights Act," Franken said.

Because your own reporting says that there's no confirmation that they briefed him orally."

Members of Congress and outside progressive groups were visibly disturbed and disappointed that several members of the Congressional Black Caucus were not given the courtesy of testifying earlier in the committee proceedings on the nomination of Sen. Jeff Sessions -- President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for attorney general -- and instead left to testify at the end of the second day of hearings alongside outside witnesses. "To have a senator, a House member and a living civil rights legend testify at the end of all of this is the equivalent of being made to go to the back of the bus," said Rep. Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, causing applause from several members of the audience in an already palpably tense hearing room. "I've been here almost 30 years and never seen anything like this," Rep. John Lewis told a group of reporters after the hearing. Things got off to a rocky start earlier in the week when Committee Chairman Sen. Chuck Grassley instead scheduled a third panel for the lawmakers on the second day of testimony, with additional outside supporters of Sessions -- a strategic move that was perceived by congressional sources as a way to not only diminish testimony of the CBC members, but an unprecedented departure with Senate custom. "Asking three members of Congress to sit and wait until the end of the hearing to testify -- likely at the same time the Senate will be holding important budget votes -- is deeply unfair," Feinstein said in a statement. A spokesperson for Grassley told CNN that Feinstein's request came late, after the hearing had already been set, and "it would have been disrespectful to make the other witnesses wait who were already slated to testify on the citizen panel," and so he tried to "accommodate all witnesses in the fairest way." A spokesperson for Sessions declined to comment. But Senate Democrats went out of their way to highlight the issue Wednesday at the culmination of two days of hearings where the treatment of African-Americans in the justice system loomed large. "I regret that the chairman has decided to break committee tradition and make these members of Congress wait until the end of the hearing to speak. That is not how other chairmen have treated fellow members of Congress," said former chairman Sen. Patrick Leahy in his opening remarks. Sen. Minority Leader Chuck Schumer also spoke out on the controversy on Senate floor Wednesday. "I regret that a sitting US senator had to fight to earn the right to speak at the Judiciary hearing ... and I regret the manner in which he was treated," Schumer said. Whether insult, oversight or otherwise -- the timing of the witnesses' testimony did not distract from the content of their statements, as TV cable outlets carried the testimony live Wednesday afternoon. Booker said after his testimony he was not bothered by Grassley's scheduling choice, nor any criticism he has received from colleagues for testifying against a fellow senator. "Yeah, I've been criticized," Booker said. "(B)ut if you're not being criticized in America, you're probably not doing a lot of good things." "Yeah, I've been criticized," Booker said.

Throughout the 2016 campaign, Clinton's most senior aides blamed Russia for the hacks targeting Democrats, including into Clinton campaign manager John Podesta's email account. In October, Clinton's campaign -- using national press secretary Brian Fallon as their narrator -- released a 6-minute video detailing how, according to their experts, Putin and Russia were looking to aide Trump in an attempt to thwart Clinton's campaign. A number of Clinton's former aides tweeted the video on Tuesday after CNN's report published. Jenna Lowenstein, Clinton's former digital director, "Truth," added Nick Merrill, Clinton's traveling press secretary and one of a few aides who is still working for the former secretary of state. CNN reported on Tuesday that the four senior-most US intelligence leaders briefed President Barack Obama and Trump last week about how allegations that Russian operatives claim to have compromising personal and financial information about the President-elect. The senior intelligence officials told Trump that Russian intelligence had compiled information potentially harmful to both political parties, but only released information damaging to Hillary Clinton and Democrats, according to sources with knowledge of the briefing. "It is frustration and disappointment that a lot of the indications of what is coming to light were out before the election but it didn't get the focus and the attention that it deserved," Jesse Ferguson, a former Clinton spokesman said, arguing that the content in leaked emails - controversies, perceived slights and other salacious details -- were covered more closely than where the information was coming from. Clinton and her aides have long given up any challenge to Trump's November win. But the former secretary of state, now reflecting on why she lost, has primarily blamed Russia and a grudge held by Vladimir Putin for her unexpected loss. "Vladimir Putin himself directed the covert cyber attacks against our electoral system, against our democracy, apparently because he has a personal beef against," Her aides, many of whom are now looking for work and spending considerably more time following the ups and downs of news, are also steaming about how they tried - but failed - to successfully convey Putin's meddling in the 2016 election. After reports of the Democratic National Committee hack went public in June, Clinton's campaign spent the next five months looking to convince voters, reporters and Trump supporters that Russia was releasing the materials in an attempt to help Trump's candidacy. Former aides recall countless meetings, conference calls and strategy sessions about pushing the story. For example, Clinton's communications team was in a meeting about Russian hacking and their communications strategy around it when the Washington Post published the "Access Hollywood" video where Trump graphically talked about assaulting women. All of this contributes to what has become a common feeling among Clinton aides: It is not our fault the story didn't get out. Instead, Clinton's aides blame reporters for the fact the story didn't fully take hold before voters went to the polls in November. "I haven't been watching this thinking to myself, damn, I wish I had done this," said one former Clinton aide. "I don't want to sit here and be arrogant and say, 'oh no, we did everything perfect.' When you lose and when the story is not told, then there is always something you could have done different. But would it have changed the outcome? I don't know." The aide added: "Frankly, I think the media blew it." Robby Mook, Clinton's campaign manager, In response, Mook was mocked. "What a joke," said Jason Miller, Trump's spokesman. A piece in the New York Observer, a publication owned by Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, compared the campaign manager to Joe McCarthy, the infamous senator from Wisconsin who led the charge in the 1950s to root out Communism in the United States. Clinton's aides now universally hold Mook's interview up with regard. "That held up well," said Ferguson. Democrats may now be in a worse position for pushing this story than they were during the campaign, though. Former Clinton aides said on Wednesday that there is no "coordinated effort" before Clinton's former employees to push the Trump story and that most aides are pushing the issue on their own. "There is a Google group about job options, but there is not that kind of structure," joked one former aide. Democratic groups looking to oppose Trump are in the nascent process of being formed, though. The Democratic National Committee is building a "war room" to combat Trump led by Zac Petkanas, the Clinton campaign's rapid-response director, and Adrienne Watson, a Clinton spokeswoman, and outside groups like American Bridge, an opposition research firm, have reorganized to rebuff the Republican president. "I am heartened," Petkanas said Wednesday, "that people are taking it seriously now and I think that it is better later than never." "I am heartened," Petkanas said Wednesday, "that people are taking it seriously now and I think that it is better later than never." ©New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker gave an impassioned and unprecedented plea to the Senate on Wednesday to vote against Donald Trump's nominee for attorney general and his fellow senator, Jeff Sessions. Booker, civil rights legend Georgia Rep. John Lewis and Congressional Black Caucus Chairman Rep. Cedric Richmond each delivered "The arc of the moral universe does not just naturally curve toward justice, we must bend it," Booker said. "America needs an attorney general who is resolute and determined to bend the arc. Sen. Sessions record does not speak to that desire, intention or will." Booker became the first sitting senator to testify against a fellow sitting senator at a confirmation hearing for a Cabinet position. His panel with other lawmakers and supporters of Sessions was added to the hearings at the request of the top Democrat on the committee, California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, The testimony from Booker, Lewis and Richmond Both Sessions' supporters and detractors were at times passionate in their position. Sessions and his backers defended his record as the victim of character assassination, saying that the events of his unsuccessful 1986 confirmation hearing to be a federal judge were being unfairly misconstrued 30 years later to malign a man with a record of fighting for civil rights. The Democrats and civil rights activists who testified, however, said that the record from the '80s not only stood today, but that Sessions has shown a pattern of disregard for the at-risk members of society throughout his time in the Senate. Democrats failed to land any knockout blows on Sessions during the hearing, with the Republicans on the committee unanimously coming to his defense as a fair enforcer of the law. The came closest when Minnesota Democratic Sen. Al Franken questioned Sessions on exaggerating his civil rights record in past statements and his Senate questionnaire. But the committee also treated Sessions with respect and warmness as a fellow colleague, a fact noted by his former staffer on the Judiciary Committee, William Smith. "Members of this committee know Sen. Sessions ... is fair and honest," Smith said. "After 20 years of knowing Sen. Sessions, I have not seen the slightest evidence of racism because it does not exist. I know a racist when I see one, and I have seen more than one. Sen. Sessions is not one." Sessions will likely be confirmed by the GOP majority Senate. Booker's decision to testify has thrust him -- already a fixture on lists of potential 2020 presidential candidates -- into the limelight. Booker said his "conscience" and "country" motivated him to speak out against his fellow senator, even though he acknowledged he has enjoyed "collegiality" with Sessions, working on a bill to give the Congressional Gold Medal to civil rights marchers. "Yeah, I've been criticized, but if you're not being criticized in America, you're probably not doing a lot of good things," Booker said after the hearing. The panel focused significantly on the issue of "law and order," which Sessions himself touted as part of his tough-on-crime pitch to be attorney general. While his supporters praised Sessions for being a "law and order" candidate, his critics say that "law and order" is more than law enforcement -- and Lewis spoke about how "law and order" was used to justify oppression when he grew up in the Jim Crow South. "Law and order without justice is unobtainable," Booker said. "They are inextricably tied together. If there is no justice, there is no peace." Booker said Sessions would uphold the responsibility of the Justice Department in pursuing "civil rights, equal rights, and justice for all of our citizens." "In many times in his career, he has demonstrated a hostility toward these convictions," Booker said. Lewis also testified against Sessions, citing his experience and history of the civil rights movement. "It doesn't matter how Sen. Sessions may smile, how friendly he may be, how he may speak to you, but we need someone who's going to stand up, speak up and speak out for the people who need help, for people who have been discriminated against," Lewis said. "We all live in the same house -- the American house. We need someone as attorney general who is going to look out for all of us and not just for some of us," he added. Richmond said the Congressional Black Caucus also opposed the nomination, and added his objection to the fact that he, Lewis and Booker were not given the courtesy of testifying earlier in the proceedings. "To have a senator, a House member and a living civil rights legend testify at the end of all of this is the equivalent of being made to go to the back of the bus," Richmond said. Sessions allies who have previously worked with him testified on his behalf, saying the media portrayal of Sessions during the hearing doesn't match their experience. "One of the things I can say about Jeff is that he's always been the same person that I've known," said Willie Huntley, a former assistant United States attorney in Alabama. "He's always been available for me and always been there when I needed him. At no point in the time that I've known Jeff has he demonstrated any racial insensitivity." South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham also asked the president of the NAACP about the racial equality organization's scorecard, reading aloud the rankings each member of the panel had received. Every Republican had 11% to 29%, while every Democrat save one had 100% -- and the exception got a 96% rating. "You're picking things that conservative Republicans don't agree with you on and liberal Democrats do. I hope that doesn't make us all racist, and all of them are perfect," Graham said in a display of frustration. "Maybe we're all wrong and maybe we're all right. I doubt if it's that way."

Carter Page is a former Trump adviser whose reportedly close ties to Russia have been called into question during the campaign. The FBI looked into "Carter Page is an individual whom the President-elect does not know and was put on notice months ago by the campaign," Sean Spicer, the incoming White House press secretary, said Wednesday. Trump, however, does at least know Page's name. In an On March 21, Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks Page founded an investment company, Global Energy Capital, and Page has He In a September appearance on CNN's "State of the Union," Kellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager, said Page was It's unclear whether Trump knows Page personally, but it's evident Page was involved in the campaign as an early adviser. We rate Spicer's claim that Trump does not know Page By Lisa Rose, CNN Trump claimed he has no business ties with Russia, and punctuated his point by declaring that if he wanted to build in Russia, he could effortlessly find partners for a venture. "I have no deals in Russia," Trump said. "I have no deals that could happen in Russia because we've stayed away. ... We could make deals in Russia very easily if we wanted to. I just don't want to because I think that would be a conflict." It would be much easier to verify Trump's claim if his tax returns were public information. But because he hasn't turned over his IRS records, we'll have to look at prior comments he's made and news stories about his international business interests. As recently as 2013, the President-elect was negotiating a deal with Aras Agalarov, a Russian billionaire, to build a Trump Tower in Moscow, Agalarov told the Post that although the plan to bring the Trump brand to Moscow didn't pan out, he hoped his family can partner with the Trumps at some point in the future. While Trump claimed that it would be a piece of cake to build one of his signature monoliths in Moscow, he has been trying unsuccessfully to cut a deal in Russia for three decades. In 1987, he visited the Soviet Union with his first wife, Ivana, and announced plans to develop a luxury hotel there. Nine years later, he filed paperwork to trademark the name Trump Tower in Russia and subsequently registered other business names such as Trump International Hotel and Tower, and Trump Home, "Russia is one of the hottest places in the world for investment," Trump said during a 2007 court deposition. "We will be in Moscow at some point." Trump's declaration that he and his company have stayed away from Russia is also dubious. He journeyed to Moscow in 2013 for the Miss Universe pageant, schmoozed with a clutch of oligarchs at a nightspot and ultimately collected $14 million from Russians who invested in the beauty contest, according to The Washington Post. Trump's son, Donald Jr., made a half dozen business trips to Russia in 2007 and 2008 on behalf of the Trump Organization, according to the travel industry publication "In terms of high-end product influx into the US, Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets; say in Dubai, and certainly with our project in SoHo and anywhere in New York," Trump Jr. said in the eTurboNews story. "We see a lot of money pouring in from Russia." Indeed. The President-elect earned nearly $100 million when he sold a Florida mansion to a Russian oligarch named Dmitry Rybolovlev in 2008. During a press conference in July, Trump said that the sale of the mansion was his one and only link to Russia. "That was a number of years ago," Trump said at the July press conference. He then conceded, "I guess probably I sell condos to Russians, OK?" It is true that there are no Trump-branded properties under construction in Moscow or elsewhere in the country but there is no way to verify the President-elect's claim that he is completely clear of business links to Russia without seeing his tax returns. His statement that Russia doesn't interest him is in contrast with decades of business trips and talk of grand plans for Moscow. His remarks aren't outright false but we cannot give his claims the green light because he hasn't disclosed his tax returns. Our verdict: By Jen Christensen, CNN Trump said the US government "is the worst" when it comes to the nation's vulnerability in being hacked. "If you look at the retail industry, if you look at the banking industry, various industries, out of 17 industries -- they put this in a category of an industry -- the United States is last in terms of protecting, let's say hacking defense," he said. That claim is When compared to 17 entities, including private retail and health care, the startup ranks the US government at the very bottom. The government is vulnerable to hacking, the report suggests, as it struggles with overall network security issues, software patching problems and malware infections. The problem, in part, stems from the large size of federal agencies; however, the report says, the upside is that those agencies may have larger budgets and larger security teams to deal with a hack attack. Hacking has been a problem for the US government before. In July 2015, President Barack Obama "Our economy is more digitized, it's more vulnerable, partly because we're a wealthier nation and we're more wired than other nations," Obama said. By Eve Bower, CNN Repeating a claim he has made several times in recent weeks, Trump appeared certain when he said, "I have a no-conflict-of-interest provision as president." Specifically, he added, "I could actually run my business and run government at the same time." The reality is much less clear-cut. Though there are a number of laws designed to prevent conflicts of interest for other public servants -- and do not apply to the President -- there are other constitutional and federal statutory provisions that may indeed be interpreted to restrict the business dealings of the President. Nine such provisions were One key question concerns a part of the Constitution known as the Emoluments Clause, which prohibits the president from receiving gifts from foreign governments. Because courts have not interpreted this provision in detail, it is unclear whether the various interests of the Trump Organization could become a conflict for the President-elect.

"Ninety-six million really wanting a job and they can't get. You know that story. The real number. That's the real number," he said in defense of his plan to implement a border tax to keep American companies from moving jobs outside the US. Here's the real deal on that stat: Some In addition, about 1.8 million are listed as marginally attached -- people who are not in the labor force who have looked for a job sometime in the past year -- and nearly 4.1 million are not marginally attached but want a job. Some economists argue that the official unemployment figure -- 7.5 million in December -- understates the true state of the job market because it only counts people who are out of a job and have looked for work in the past four weeks. A wider measure of unemployment includes people who've left the labor force but want a job, and part-timers who want full-time positions. Altogether, these three types of job-seekers total about 16 million, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.

Here's how it unfolded, minute-by-minute. All times eastern: Spicer "We stopped giving them," he said, "because we were getting quite a bit of inaccurate news." "As far as (election season) hacking," he continues, He adds: "I'm also very much of a germaphobe. Believe me." "The only ones who cares about my tax returns are reporters," Trump tells the questioner, a statement not backed up As CNN's Jill Disis and Jeremy Diamond Of the timing of the replacement, Trump adds, "The word is now out that when you want to move your plant to Mexico or some other place and you want to fire all of your workers from Michigan and Ohio and all these places that I won for good reason... not gonna happen that way anymore," he says. Trump adds: "We don't have border" but "an open sieve," and urges companies to shop state-to-state for better deals -- "as long as it's within the borders of the United States." He says negotiations with Mexico will begin shortly after he takes office. The country, he adds, will "in some form" reimburse the US for the cost of construction and says the "deal" will probably happen in less than 18 months. He says that recent intelligence leaks were like something the government in Nazi Germany "would have done and did do." Trump dodges the question. He speaks for 88 seconds -- about the "respect" Russia will have for him; Chinese hackers; if his administration will "get along" with Putin (maybe); Hillary Clinton's On the way out, Trump explains that the stacks of papers and folders propped up on the table beside the podium are "all just a piece of the many, many companies that are being put into trust ©President-elect Donald Trump said for the first time Wednesday he believes Russia was responsible for hacking ahead of the election but contemptuously rejected allegations that Moscow mounted a campaign to compromise him. In his first news conference since winning the election, a combative Trump made clear he will not mute his style when he is inaugurated in nine days. He lashed out at media and political foes alike in a bravura performance. The Trump Tower press conference confirmed the President-elect's deep desire to quickly assert power once he's sworn in. He insisted on moving speedily -- too speedily for some Republicans in Congress -- to replace Obamacare. He also pledged swift action on building a But it's also clear Trump will take office amid persistent questions about his relationship with Russia. While Trump was at the podium, his nominee to become secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, faced tough questions on Capitol Hill about whether the incoming administration will view Russia with sufficient skepticism. At the news conference, Trump finally conceded he believes Russian President Vladimir Putin's intelligence agencies were behind hacks on Democratic computers ahead of the election but argued that wouldn't happen again. "I think it was Russia," Trump said. Putin "should not be doing it. He won't be doing it. Russia will have much greater respect for our country when I am leading it than when other people have led it." Trump, who has vowed to improve relations with Russia despite some Republican opposition, said he did not know if he would get along with Putin and noted it's possible he won't. But he could not resist a swipe at his defeated Democratic election rival, Hillary Clinton. "Do you honestly believe Hillary would be tougher on Putin than me?" he asked. He added that Russia is not the only nation that hacks US targets and accused Democrats of not having sufficient cybersecurity programs. The news conference opened with the incoming White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, slamming a "political witch hunt" following reports that Russian operatives claim to have compromising personal and financial information about Trump. Vice President-elect Mike Pence also criticized the media before introducing Trump, who kept up his criticism of US intelligence. "I must say that I want to thank a lot of the news organizations here today because they looked at that nonsense that was released by maybe the intelligence agencies," Trump said. He said any such move by the agencies would be a "tremendous blot on their record." "A thing like that should never have been written, it should never have been had and it certainly should have never been released," Trump said. The news conference follows The FBI is investigating the credibility and accuracy of these allegations, which are based primarily on information from Russian sources, but has not confirmed many essential details in the memos about Trump. The news conference, delayed from December, was scheduled for Trump to outline how he will address questions about possible conflicts-of-interest related to his vast business empire. Trump appeared beside a large pile of files he claimed were pertinent to the companies that are going to be placed in a trust to be run by his sons. He reiterated that he doesn't plan to After taking a handful of questions, Trump turned the event over to Sheri Dillon, an attorney who was on hand to discuss Trump's business interests. She said Trump planned to put in place a structure that will "completely isolate him from the management of the company." "He further instructed that we build in protections that will assure the American people that the decisions that he makes and the actions he takes as President are for their benefit and not to support his financial interests," she said. Trump will place all his financial and business assets in a trust, Dillon said. The Trump Organization, meanwhile, will not enter into any new deals abroad and all domestic deals will be subject to a heavy vetting process. The firm will also appoint a new ethics officer, she said. The President-elect has also terminated a number of deals set to close shortly, a step that had cost him millions of dollars, she said. Dillon argued that the decision had been made not to put all Trump's assets in a blind trust or to divest of all his assets because it would be impractical. She also said that Trump should not be forced to destroy the business that he had built up. "President Trump can't unknow he owns Trump Tower," Dillon said, explaining why a blind trust would not be a workable solution to addressing conflicts of interest issues while he is President. Dillon said Trump would take other actions to avoid the appearance of a conflict over the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, which prohibits the president from accepting gifts from foreign governments unless authorized by Congress. She said it was unfair to apply the clause to Trump's "arm's length" transactions that he had nothing to do with or was not aware of. "Just like with conflicts of interests, he wants to do more than what the Constitution requires," she said. "President-elect Trump has decided and we are announcing today that he is going to voluntarily donate all profits from foreign government payments made to his hotels to the United States Treasury." When he returned to the podium, Trump turned to policy, vowing to press ahead with a near simultaneous repeal and replacement of Obamacare at the same time, rejecting the approach of some Republicans on Capitol Hill who worry that rushing could create problems. "It will be repeal and replace. It will be essentially simultaneously," he said, saying the two goals would be accomplished in the same week, day or even hour. Trump reiterated that he will build a wall on the southern border and Mexico will pay for it, but defended his decision to ask Congress to fund it initially. "We are going to build a wall," he said, adding that he didn't want to wait a year and a half to finish negotiating how Mexico would pay for it. "Mexico, in some form ... will reimburse us." He added that the financing was more likely to take the form of a tax than a payment. The President-elect also said he had been looking at the list of 20 potential Supreme Court nominees he had proposed to replace late Justice Antonin Scalia. He said he would announce his decision "within two weeks of the 20th, probably the second week." He said he would announce his decision "within two weeks of the 20th, probably the second week." ©It's been nearly six months since Donald J. Trump has been at the podium taking questions from reporters. But his bravado, tart taunts of reporters, and his creative use of the facts were as dominant as they were throughout his campaign. Trump veered in the opposite direction. He was confrontational, combative, piqued by his perceived mistreatment in the press, and insistent that he had the right to keep running his business the way he wanted. Obama, as well as Trump's other predecessors, like to say that presidents grow into the role of commander-in-chief once they grasp the gravity of the Oval Office. Nine days away from the presidency, Trump isn't showing any evidence of that kind of transformation. Instead, in an appearance that will serve as the prelude to his presidency, Trump showed he will keep playing the same familiar role: The self-assured provocateur who will slash anyone he believes might have crossed him. Esteemed institutions of government like the nation's top intelligence agencies won't be immune. Trump had a lot to cover Wednesday at a news conference that was initially scheduled for December and was supposed to outline how he would deal with the conflicts of interests facing him and his hundreds of companies. He said he was But Trump's chief preoccupation Wednesday was the question of whether Russia meddled in the US election. Though he conceded for the first time that he believed Russian President Vladimir Putin's intelligence operatives were involved in hacking Democratic computers, he still refused to accept the widely-held view that Putin interceded to try to help him win the presidency. In one gasp-worthy statement given the contentious relationship between the US and Russia right now, he said "If Putin likes Donald Trump, guess what folks, that's called an asset, not a liability." Trump's twin targets were US intelligence agencies and Furious that Buzzfeed printed the unsubstantiated allegations in their totality ( "I must say that I want to thank a lot of the news organizations here today because they looked at that nonsense that was released by maybe the intelligence agencies," Trump said. "A thing like that should never have been written, it should never have been had and it certainly should have never been released." He sought to conflate the actions of Buzzfeed and CNN. Unlike Buzzfeed, CNN did not publish any of the details of the 35-page document because reporters had not corroborated the report's allegations. Nevertheless -- throwing typical presidential press conference protocol to the wind -- Trump shouted repeatedly over CNN's Jim Acosta as the senior White House correspondent attempted to ask Trump questions. "Since you're attacking us, can you give us a question?" Acosta pressed Trump. "Not you, your organization is terrible," Trump said, lashing out at Acosta. "You are fake news." "The Trump team knows this," the statement said. "They are using Buzzfeed's decision to deflect from CNN's reporting, which has been matched by the other major news organizations." With all that heat and fireworks around the Russian intelligence reporting, Trump left many questions about his business dealings unanswered. But he couldn't resist a quip alluding to his days as a television star on "The Apprentice." If his sons run the company well, he said he'll praise them, otherwise he said they'll be subject to his most famous line: "You're fired."

Trump's eldest daughter will divest of significant assets, including all of her common stock, and convert her equity in the Trump Organization into fixed payments, per an official briefing on behalf of the transition. Her decision to take these steps, according to the official, stems from her husband's participation in the administration not her father's. It was announced earlier this week that Ivanka's husband, Jared Kushner, will be senior adviser to the president. But while Ivanka Trump has no formal title within the President-elect's administration yet, she played a key role advising her father during the campaign, and it is unlikely that will change. Trump transition aides are planning for an "Office of the First Family," in the East Wing where the current office of the first lady is located, sources familiar with the plan told CNN in December, and Ivanka is expected to play a prominent role in the White House. Donald Trump, as president, is exempt from federal conflict of interest laws. But officials who work for him must agree to avoid business interests that could conflict with their government roles. The fixed payments mean she will have no access to profits from the business -- a major break from the arrangement announced by her father Wednesday, which is already being criticized by the Office of Government Ethics. The President-elect will put his investments and business holdings into some type of trust controlled by sons Donald Jr. and Eric, who will lead the Trump Organization while their father is in office. "She wants to go beyond what her father did, because she doesn't believe he has to deal with conflicts, she wants to. The reason she wants to? She plans to be a 'modern-day first daughter,'" said Monica Langley, a CNN political analyst and senior special writer at the Wall Street Journal. "She's going to be in the West Wing and be one of his top advisers." Ivanka Trump is taking a formal leave of absence from the Trump Organization and her apparel and accessories brand when her father assumes office, she wrote in a Facebook post Wednesday. "I will no longer be involved with the management or operations of either company," she wrote.

It's unclear how she will disentangle her involvement with the upcoming March release of her book, "Women Who Work: Rewriting the Rules for Success." Trump announced Wednesday that she has has appointed Abigail Klem as president of her lifestyle brand. Trump and Kushner recently settled on a home in Washington's Kalorama neighborhood, where they will move from New York with their three children, ages 5, 3, and 9 months, in the coming weeks. She is still deciding what role she wants to play in the new administration, but one arena where the businesswoman plans to focus: women's investment and empowerment. "I'm grateful for the overwhelming amount of outreach I've received from people all across America who have shared their stories and offered to extend their ideas and expertise in the areas I am deeply passionate about, including the education and empowerment of women and girls; leveling the playing field for female entrepreneurs and job creators and unleashing the potential of women in the workplace. I am eager to hear more from them as I determine the most impactful and appropriate ways for me to serve our country," she wrote.

In an unusual statement on Wednesday evening that highlighted tensions between spy chiefs and the incoming president, James Clapper, a key adviser to the US President on security and intelligence, rejected a suggestion by Trump that the agencies were responsible for the story going public. Clapper said he told Trump that intelligence agencies made no judgment about the reliability of the allegations. The claims were summarized in a two-page synopsis prepared for Trump and Barack Obama ahead of a national security briefing last week. Clapper's statement amounted to the first public confirmation from a US official of In his first news conference as President-elect on Wednesday, Trump Before speaking with reporters, Trump went further in his attack. He said in a tweet: "Intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to 'leak' into the public. One last shot at me. Are we living in Nazi Germany?" On Thursday, Trump confirmed on Twitter he had received a call from Clapper: "James Clapper called me yesterday to denounce the false and fictitious report that was illegally circulated. Made up, phony facts.Too bad!" Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, expressed skepticism at Trump's claim that Clapper denounced the report. "Sadly, you simply cannot rely on the President-elect's tweets or statements about what he's receiving in intelligence briefings, and that's a real problem," Schiff told CNN's Chris Cuomo on "New Day." The two-page synopsis -- appended to a report on Russian interference in the 2016 US election campaign -- was based on 35 pages of memos prepared by a former British intelligence operative working initially for Republican opponents of Trump, gathering opposition research about him during the presidential campaign, multiple US officials with direct knowledge of the briefings told CNN. Clapper said in his statement that the synopsis was included in the briefing because "part of our obligation is to ensure that policymakers are provided with the fullest possible picture of any matters that might affect national security." "The [intelligence community] has not made any judgment that the information in this document is reliable, and we did not rely upon it in any way for our conclusions," Clapper noted. It has not been established whether the agencies raised the material from the two-page synopsis directly with Trump at their recent meeting. But the issue came up in Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo's confirmation hearing to head the CIA Thursday. Asked by Maine Independent Sen. Angus King if Pompeo would explore questions that arose in those reports, Pompeo stressed that the allegations were unsubstantiated and that he considered the "leaks that occurred" to be "intensely serious." Pompeo acknowledged Clapper's statement and pledged that he "will pursue the facts wherever they will take us ... with respect to this issue and to each and every issue as well." At his press conference on Wednesday, Trump attacked CNN and Buzzfeed for their coverage of the story. CNN revealed only that intelligence officials had summarized the claims about Trump and prepared a briefing document, as it could not verify the claims contained in the full 35-page set of memos prepared by the former British intelligence operative. Buzzfeed published the full, unverified memos. The clash between Trump, the intelligence agencies and the media makes it clear that the President-elect will take office amid persistent questions about his relationship with Russia.

James Mattis abruptly canceled his appearance before the House Armed Services Committee slated for Thursday. The move is triggering a backlash from top House Democrats who say without hearing directly from Mattis they will oppose legislation paving the way for his confirmation. "The Republicans have been spending eight years complaining about the executive branch usurping legislative branch power and here's their first move from the new administration is to ignore us on something," Rep. Adam Smith, D-Washington, the top Democrat on the panel told reporters Wednesday. Smith added, "This is a law. We have to pass it and we want to hear from him and if we don't we are going to vote no." Current law prohibits anyone who has served in the military in the last seven years to have a top leadership position in the Pentagon. That means Congress needs to pass a law that provides an exception for Mattis, who retired three years ago, to serve as defense secretary before the Senate votes on his confirmation. Smith told reporters that Trump transition officials made the decision to pull Mattis from the House hearing Wednesday. Mattis did initially agree to House Armed Services Chairman Mac Thornberry's request to appear and answer questions from members about taking a job typically held by civilians. "General Mattis' current focus is on following the constitutional process for confirmation by the United States Senate and testifying at his confirmation hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee, if confirmed he looks forward to working with both the Senate and House Armed Services Committees, which play critical roles in supporting our forces and ensuring civilian control of the military," said Alleigh Marre, a Trump transition spokeswoman. House Republican leaders scheduled a vote for Friday on a bill to provide Mattis with a waiver, and even with potentially large numbers of Democratic defections GOP aides say they are confident the measure will pass. Thornberry is expected to support the bill, according to an aide, despite the dust-up on the hearing. Mattis already had a busy day slated for Thursday, when he will testify at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee. That panel is also expected to approve the Mattis waiver bill later in the day. Since he was tapped by President-elect Donald Trump to lead the Pentagon Mattis has received bipartisan praise for his military career. While some have expressed concerns about setting aside the precedent of maintaining civilian leadership in the military, it's expected that the waiver legislation will be approved by both chambers and Mattis will be confirmed as one of the first Cabinet members. Senate leaders are aiming to have his confirmation vote on Inauguration Day, January 20.

Jeff Sessions, who is Donald Trump's pick to be attorney general, is part of an ongoing "war on whites" by Democrats. "It's really about political power and racial division and what I've referred to on occasion as the 'war on whites.' They are trying to motivate the African-American vote to vote-bloc for Democrats by using every 'Republican is a racist' tool that they can envision," the Republican congressman said on " Brooks was responding to a question about criticism of Sessions' record on civil rights, which has come under renewed scrutiny as he seeks confirmation to head the Justice Department. Sessions was denied a federal judgeship in 1986 in part because of comments he allegedly made about organizations like the NAACP and the American Civil Liberties Union. Sessions, a Republican, also criticized the 1965 Voting Rights Act as "intrusive" in the 1980s. In his confirmation hearing on Tuesday, Sessions called charges of racism "damnably false," saying that he had prosecuted a voter fraud case in response to "pleas from African-American, incumbent, elected officials." Brooks, who said in Tuesday's radio interview that he was under consideration by Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley to replace Sessions in the US Senate, was defending Sessions in regard to his position on voting rights. "Well, to get right down to it, it's all about political power, and the Democrats are not shy about lying in order to achieve their political goals," he said. "And if they have to besmirch the reputation of a good man, Jeff Sessions, in order to achieve their political goals, they as a group are not hesitant to do so." Brooks previously Brooks previously ©Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson endured a rocky cross-examination Wednesday on the perennial question of how to balance America's national security interests with its advocacy for human rights. Tillerson faced a grilling from Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, who represents a vital vote in the narrowly-split Senate and could have outsize influence on whether Donald Trump's pick to be the top US diplomat is confirmed. The Florida senator put Tillerson on the spot on human rights violations in Russia and the Philippines especially, and later told reporters he was undecided whether to back him after hours of Senate confirmation hearings. The tug of war between advocacy for human rights and strategic interests has been a recurring theme across administrations since Jimmy Carter's presidency. Tillerson's answers in the hearing, his own past dealings with autocratic leaders as head of ExxonMobil and Trump's apparent admiration for strong leaders like Russian President Vladimir Putin, have some human rights advocates and lawmakers concerned that the incoming Trump administration will pay little heed to human rights as it frames its foreign policy approaches and could fall further off the American agenda. In 2005, in his second inaugural address, President George W. Bush proposed a freedom agenda to push democratic change around the world but critics later said he did not live up to those heady vows. The outgoing Obama administration has also been criticized for not giving human rights a more prominent role in its dealings with US adversaries like Iran, Cuba and China. Now, human rights advocacy groups are registering increasing concern about the incoming Trump administration's position on the issue. Rubio, who lost to Trump in the Republican primary, has carved out a role as a foreign policy expert and hawk on Capitol Hill, and may see his interest in global issues as a way to restore momentum in his political career. He opened up by asking Tillerson whether he considered Russia's air attacks on civilian areas of the formerly held rebel city of Aleppo in Syria amounted to violations of the rules of war and war crimes. "Those are very, very serious charges to make, and I would want to have much more information before reaching a conclusion," Tillerson, said. Rubio then narrowed in on the issue of Russia, and the new administration's plans to try to improve strained US relations with the Kremlin. "Mr. Tillerson, do you believe that Vladimir Putin and his cronies are responsible for ordering the murder of countless dissidents, journalists and political opponents?" Rubio asked in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. Tillerson replied: "People who speak up for freedom and regimes that are oppressive are often at threat and these things happen to them. In terms of assigning specific responsibilities, I would have to have more information." Rubio was not impressed. "None of this is classified, Mr. Tillerson. These people are dead." The former ExxonMobil boss replied: "Your question was people who were directly responsible for that. I'm not disputing these people are dead." Rubio and Tillerson also clashed on Saudi Arabia when the Florida senator asked whether he was aware of human rights violations, including the treatment of women in the oil-rich kingdom. The secretary of state nominee argued that though progress towards values the United States would support was being made, it was too slow. The tension between strategic interests and US morale imperatives was also in play in Rubio's exchange with Tillerson on the Philippines, where a drugs war orchestrated by President Rodrigo Duterte has resulted in the deaths of thousands of people in extra-judicial killings. Tillerson said that he would rely on facts that would be available to him as secretary of state before weighing in, causing Rubio to pounce, noting that Duterte's claims of responsibility for the extra-judicial killings were reported in major newspapers. Tillerson argued that it was important that the US retain the Philippines as an ally in a region marked by rising tensions with China, then allowed, under intense pressure from Rubio, that Duterte's actions did not appear appropriate. "If the facts are in fact supportive of those numbers and those actions, then I don't think any of us would accept that as a proper way to deal with offenders, no matter how grievous the offenses may been," Tillerson replied. At points in the hearing, Tillerson appeared to appreciate that his answers were not cutting much ice with Rubio, and that he needed to try and bring him around. "There seems to be some misunderstanding that somehow I see the world through a different lens," Tillerson told the Florida senator. "I share all the same values that you share and want the same things for people the world over in terms of freedoms. But I am also cleared-eyed and realistic about dealing in cultures, these are centuries long cultures, cultural differences." He added, "It doesn't mean we can't affect them and affect them to change." But Democrats, keen to draw some early blood against the Trump administration, sensed Tillerson was in a tough spot on human rights questions. "It will be a surprise to a lot of people coming out of this hearing that you aren't ready today to call President Duterte a violator of human rights or to call what is happening in Saudi Arabia a named violation of human rights under international law," Democratic Sen. Christopher Murphy of Connecticut said. Again, Tillerson said that he was not going to make such judgment until he had seen all the facts, but added: "My standards are no different than yours." He then raised Democratic eyebrows further when he used a similar argument to dodge questions about whether he would oppose any plans by Trump to draw up a Muslim registry. "I would need to have a lot more information around how such an approach would even be constructed," Tillerson told New Hampshire Democrat Jeanne Shaheen. Rubio later told reporters that he would have to take time to consider his response to Tillerson's answers. "If we are going to have moral clarity in our foreign policy we need to be clear, and I don't want to see us move towards a policy where human rights matters when nothing else matters ... when something more important isn't standing in the way," Rubio said. Former US Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who served under both Bush and Obama and recommended Tillerson to Trump, defended his friend. He said Tillerson was being "properly cautious" and that he had less freedom to talk about human rights than Rubio. "If a secretary of state makes a pronouncement about a country or about an individual, then there are legal implications in terms of actions the United States has to take," Gates told CNN's Jake Tapper. "It seems to me he is trying to communicate that he has completely shared values with those senators," he said, "but if he takes this job ... he is going to end up having to make some decisions that have very real implications for our relationships with those countries." Human rights advocates, however, expressed more concern. "Rex Tillerson's reluctance to acknowledge human rights abuses by Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the Philippines raises serious questions about whether he can effectively serve as secretary of state," said Sarah Margon, Washington director of Human Rights Watch. "Tillerson's claims that he cannot pass judgment on these counties' abuses until he has access to US intelligence briefings ignores the US government's own previous findings and suggests that Tillerson is either ill-informed or apathetic to human rights issues worldwide," she said.

The American Action Network, a nonprofit funded by Ryan supporters, is beginning the television campaign nationally and in the districts of typically vulnerable Republicans. It's an effort in part to insulate House Republicans from the attempt to repeal and replace President Barack Obama's controversial healthcare law, though the GOP has yet to unify around a single plan to pass in its stead. "Imagine a new path forward," Television advertising has ground to a halt after the 2016 elections, though policy debates sometimes ignite smaller paid media campaigns by issue groups. The spots will air in 15 districts home to either those at risk in 2018 or key Republican committee chairs. The group also studied Democrats initial messaging campaign on the issue -- that Republicans want to "Make America Sick Again" -- and American Action Network head Corry Bliss dismissed it as a "publicity stunt." "Americans should know that Speaker Ryan and House Republicans have a plan to replace Obamacare with quality, affordable health care," he said in a statement.

Mexican President Enrique Pexc3xb1a Nieto made his comments at the end of a speech at an annual gathering of senior Mexican diplomats at the National Palace Wednesday. While stressing his desire for a positive relationship between the two countries and naming several issues on which he said they could cooperate, Pexc3xb1a Nieto assured his nation they would not be footing the bill for Trump's wall. "It is evident that we have some differences with the new government of the United States, like the topic of the wall, that Mexico of course will not pay," Pexc3xb1a Nieto said in the address. In the days following Congress coming back into session, reports have emerged saying Trump has moved to break with part of his signature campaign pledge -- telling members of Congress that US taxpayers would pay for the border wall and not Mexico. But at his news conference on Wednesday, Trump vociferously denied these reports in part. "Reports went out last week, 'Oh, Mexico is not going to pay for the wall because of a reimbursement.' What's the difference? I want to get the wall started," Trump said. He said the US would move to build the wall quickly, using US money to fund the project at first before getting Mexico to reimburse the US. As for the mechanism he would use to force Mexico's hand, Trump was noncommittal outside of pledging it would indeed occur. "We're going to build a wall. I could wait about a year-and-a-half until we finish our negotiations with Mexico, which we'll start immediately after we get to office, but I don't want to wait," Trump said. He also recalled the earnestness and popularity of the wall at his campaign rallies, where he regularly did a call and response with his supporters over the promise to have the US' southern neighbor pay for a border wall. "I would say, 'We are going to build a wall,' and people would go crazy," Trump said. "I say, "Who's going to pay for the wall,' and they will scream out, 'Mexico.'" During the campaign, Trump visited Mexico to meet with Pexc3xb1a Nieto. And although Nieto did not agree to fund Trump's wall at the time, afterward, Trump The stark difference between Wednesday's comments from the two North American politicians showed the disagreement remained as wide just days before Trump takes office as it was when Trump's victory was regarded as a longshot. ©The Kremlin denied it has compromising information about US President-elect Donald Trump, describing the allegations as "pulp fiction". Dmitry Peskov, spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin, said reports that Trump was the subject of "Kompromat" -- a Russian term for compromising information intended to be used against someone -- were an "attempt to harm our bilateral relationship." Multiple US officials with direct knowledge of the briefings told CNN that the synopsis included allegations that Russian operatives claim to have compromising personal and financial information about Trump. It also contained allegations of a continuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government. Trump rejected the claims. In a Twitter post Tuesday night, he said: "FAKE NEWS - A TOTAL POLITICAL WITCH HUNT!" During a conference call on Wednesday, Peskov said the claims were false. "No, the Kremlin does not have 'Kompromat' on Trump," he said in response to a question from CNN. "The information does not correspond to reality and it is complete fiction." Peskov added: "The fabrication of such lies in terms of the previous open part of the report, and this one which is a comparable lie, it's called pulp fiction in English." "Clearly there are those who are creating hysteria, who are trying to support this witch hunt, and President-elect Trump himself described it like this." CNN has reviewed a 35-page compilation of the memos from which the two-page synopsis was drawn. The memos originated as opposition research, first commissioned by anti-Trump Republicans, and later by Democrats. CNN is not reporting the details of the memos, as it has not independently corroborated the allegations. But, in preparing this story, CNN has spoken to multiple high ranking intelligence, administration, congressional and law enforcement officials, as well as foreign officials and others in the private sector with direct knowledge of the memos. The allegations came, in part, from memos compiled by a former British intelligence operative, whose past work US intelligence officials consider credible. The FBI is investigating the credibility and accuracy of the allegations, but has not confirmed many of the essential details in the memos about Trump. In the conference call, Peskov also denied that the Kremlin had compromising material on Hillary Clinton. "The Kremlin and the Russian president tries to build relationships with our foreign partners in the interests of the Russian Federation and the Russian people and for the world in the interests of stability and security," he added. Sources tell CNN that the allegations about communications between the Trump campaign and the Russians prompted then-Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid to contact FBI Director James Comey. He wrote in a letter in October: "It has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian government -- a foreign interest openly hostile to the United States." "I would never comment on investigations," Comey told Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat who repeatedly pushed the FBI director to release any information it had before Inauguration Day. Sen. Angus King of Maine, an Independent, alluded to Comey's decision to go public on the FBI's additional investigations into Hillary Clinton's emails in the closing stages of the 2016 campaign. "The irony of you making that statement I cannot avoid," King said. After the hearing, Wyden tweeted: "Director Comey refused to answer my question about whether the FBI has investigated Trump campaign contacts with Russia." After the hearing, Wyden tweeted: "Director Comey refused to answer my question about whether the FBI has investigated Trump campaign contacts with Russia." ©Senate Republicans launched their effort to repeal and replace President Barack Obama's landmark healthcare law early Thursday morning, approving a budget blueprint that they've dubbed the Obamacare "repeal resolution." The Senate voted "This resolution will set the stage for true legislative relief from Obamacare that Americans have long demanded while ensuring a stable transition," Senate Budget Chairman Mike Enzi of Wyoming said, just after 1 a.m. "The Obamacare bridge is collapsing and we're sending in a rescue team." Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, one of the most vocal GOP opponents of voting on a repeal bill before coming up with a replacement package, voted against the budget resolution and California Sen. Dianne Feinstein was absent. Senators were bleary-eyed as they walked quickly to the exits, wrapping up the final vote a little before 1:30 a.m. ET. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, the top Democrat who led the late-night fight against a repeal, said the protest could be a sign of things to come as the fight stretches on. "I think it's important for this country to know this was not a usual thing, this is a day which lays the groundwork for 30 million people to be thrown off their health insurance," Sanders said. "And if that happens, many of these people will die." "We wanted to say no matter how late, we're going to stay and fight and represent our constituents -- there are so many constituencies who will be hurt by this repeal without a replace," said New York Sen. Chuck Schumer. Democratic senators registered a somewhat subtle, but significant protest in the Senate as they cast their votes -- declaring why they were voting against the repeal, a rare move that rankled Republicans in the chamber. The House is expected take a swift vote on the resolution, possibly as early as Friday, which will trigger congressional committees to begin crafting a second bill that would roll back major parts of Obamacare. Though it will be weeks before Congress votes on that bill, Thursday still marked a victory for the Republican Party as it moves toward overhauling the country's healthcare system. President-elect Donald Trump congratulated the Senate for its actions Thursday. "Congrats to the Senate for taking the first step to #RepealObamacare- now it's onto the House!" he tweeted. Before Thursday's vote, a political spectacle known as "vote-a-rama" unfolded on the Senate floor. The largely symbolic exercise -- which began Wednesday evening and stretched into wee hours of Thursday -- was ripe for theater. However, the tone was largely subdued, missing some of the fire of voting marathons in previous years. Democrats still used the late-night drill to publicly defend the Affordable Care Act and chastise their colleagues across the aisle for starting the process of overhauling a law that gives health insurance to some 20 million Americans. Republicans, meanwhile, stressed the harmful impact of the law and the urgent need to do away with it. Senators introduced more than 160 amendments to the budget resolution, which led to a marathon session of impassioned speeches and roll call votes. Although these votes were non-binding and the budget resolution doesn't require the president's signature, the process helped crystallize the Democratic Party's top priorities as it looks to defend the major pillars of Obamacare. The most important amendments for Democrats were aimed at preserving what they argue are popular provisions of Obamacare. Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin pressed a measure to allow young adults to stay on their parents insurance until age 26. "It will block Republican efforts that would weaken dependent coverage," Baldwin said in a brief but forceful floor speech before the vote. But Republicans -- many of whom have expressed interest in maintaining the provision when they eventually replace Obamacare -- nevertheless blocked the Baldwin amendment, arguing it wasn't applicable to the underlying budget resolution. Democrats also sought to protect measures dealing with pre-existing conditions and reproductive healthcare services for women. At times, the evening also showed that Republicans and Democrats share some common goals -- even if the two political parties are bitterly divided on the merits of Obamacare. Earlier in the night, West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a moderate Democrat who has called on Republicans to work in a bipartisan fashion on repealing and replacing Obamacare, emphasized the importance of preserving coverage for patients in rural areas. No matter what happens to Obamacare, Manchin said: "We are going to make sure that we protect our rural hospitals and rural clinics." But on the same topic, Republican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming argued that it was because of Obamacare that rural hospitals have shuttered. "For people in small towns -- the closures that we've already experienced, these closures have had a devastating impact," Barrasso said. Trump has ratcheted up the pressure this week, calling on his party to act as quickly as possible. Perhaps more significantly, Trump is adamant that Republicans vote on repealing and replacing Obamacare more or less at the same time. This is a significant divergence from the party's initial thinking that it would first vote on repeal before considering replacement options. In a news conference in Wednesday, Trump told reporters that a plan will be unveiled soon after his nominee for Health and Human Services secretary, Tom Price, is confirmed. A Georgia congressman, Price is an ardent Obamacare critic and has previously introduced detailed legislation to repeal and replace the law. "We're going to be submitting -- as soon as our secretary's approved, almost simultaneously, shortly thereafter, a plan. It'll be repeal and replace. It will be essentially simultaneously," Trump said. "Probably the same day, could be the same hour." Trump appeared to be suggesting that the plan would come from his administration, but a transition spokesman told CNN that he couldn't confirm whether that was Trump's intention. Even as Republicans advanced the plan to roll back Obamacare, plans to replace were still being formulated. To that end, a small group of relatively moderate Republican senators -- including Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski -- initially pushed a change that would give senators until March to develop a plan to replace Obamacare. But the senators dropped that push as it became clear Wednesday that Republican leaders were moving toward replacing Obamacare as they repeal it. Vice President-elect Mike Pence met with senators at the Capitol Wednesday. As he exited his meeting with Pence, Manchin said that the incoming VP promised a draft replacement for Obamacare would be available in 30-60 days. Republicans on the Hill do not yet have a plan for replacing Obamacare, and are considering a series of possible legislative paths to replace what they vote to repeal. It's also not clear that one comprehensive "replacement" bill will ultimately emerge from GOP lawmakers -- in fact, senior leaders are currently weighing the option of incremental replacement bills. For example, they are exploring whether replacement measures could be inserted into the "repeal" reconciliation bill, which Republicans hope to vote on by late February or March. Leaders are also looking into whether any replacement or healthcare reform measures could be inserted into reauthorization bills that Congress is expected to take up later this year.

Marco Rubio. Rubio -- who refused to say if he would vote for Tillerson after a day of testimony -- pressed the former ExxonMobil CEO hard Wednesday on a slew of human rights questions, pushing him to denounce the behavior of Russia, China, Saudi Arabia and the Philippines and expressing deep disappointment when the Texan refused to do so. Rubio's vote could make the difference in Tillerson's progress, as Republicans have only a one-vote margin on the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee and Democrats may not support him. But it is possible, should Tillerson stall in committee, for the Senate to bypass the panel and bring the nomination to the full Senate for a vote. "This is a very important decision and I recognize the partisan split on the committee and what it means," Rubio told reporters after the hearing. "I'm prepared to do what's right." The Florida senator -- who lost to Trump in the GOP presidential primary and had heated personal exchanges with him during the campaign -- told Tillerson that "moral clarity" is crucial to US foreign policy and expressed disbelief that Tillerson wouldn't deliver judgments on countries' alleged human rights abuses when information is widely available. "The position you've been nominated to is, in my opinion, the second-most important position of the US government, with all due respect to the vice president," Rubio said. When the world sees that "the United States is not prepared to stand up and say, yes, Vladimir Putin is a war criminal, Saudi Arabia violates human rights, it demoralizes these people all over the world," Rubio said. Rubio wasn't alone on the fence. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said he is also undecided about Trump's choice. "I think probably what happened today is he is a good man, an honest guy, well qualified in terms of his life experience, but I don't think he grew the vote today," Graham said. "I think there are a lot of Democrats that may have been thinking about voting for him are going to have a harder time of it." Graham said Tillerson failed to answer a key question at this hearing about what he intends to do about Russian election-related hacking. "Real fuzzy answer," Graham said. "He needs to clear that up. If he doesn't clear that up, it would be a problem, and I think he can clear it up and he needs to clear it up." Tillerson did get one small bit of good news - Sen. James Lankford, a Republican from Oklahoma, indicated on CNN's "Erin Burnett Out Front" that he is "leaning" toward a yes vote on Tillerson, but still wants to review more materials. During his day-long testimony, Tillerson Tillerson said he wasn't against TPP, a massive trade pact that Trump condemned as he made staunch opposition to free trade deals a centerpiece of his presidential campaign. "I do not oppose" TPP, Tillerson told the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee. "I share some of (Trump's) views regarding whether the agreement that was negotiated serves all of America's interests the best." Tillerson also blasted Russia's invasion of Ukraine as an "illegal action" -- something Trump hasn't done -- and said he even would have sent the country defensive weapons to use against Moscow. In a striking exchange, Tillerson admitted that he'd only spoken to the President-elect about world affairs in general terms, and that they haven't discussed Russian policy, telling the Senate panel "that has not yet occurred." And he took steps in his opening remarks to strike an overall tougher line on Moscow than Trump has to date, saying, "Russia must know that we will be accountable to our commitments and those of our allies, and that Russia must be held to account for its actions."xc2xa0 On climate change, Tillerson told the senators he believes "the risk of climate change does exist and the consequences of it could be serious enough that actions should be taken." In contrast, Trump has in the past described climate change as a hoax perpetrated by China to hurt US manufacturers, although he recently acknowledged the possibility that human activity could be a contributing factor. He expressed respect for Mexico, calling it "a longstanding neighbor and friend of this country." In sharp contrast to Trump, who said during the campaign that the country sends undocumented rapists and criminals to the US, Tillerson said, "I would never characterize an entire population by any single term at all." And he distanced himself from calls to create a registry of American Muslims. "I do not support targeting any particular group," he said. He also rejected Trump's campaign suggestion that South Korea and Japan should consider developing nuclear arsenals. "I do not agree," he said, adding, "We simply cannot back away from our commitment" to reduce nuclear weapons. Tillerson encountered repeated challenges from senators on Russia and on ExxonMobil's track record on climate change and the company's opposition to sanctions against rogue regimes. It was enough, at the hearing's halfway point, for Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York to tweet about the President-elect or "PEOTUS" and his State Department nominee. "Tillerson hearing raises real questions as to whether PEOTUS & cabinet are prepared to stand up to Putin, Iran & represent US interests," Schumer said. In a departure from the pattern, Tillerson noted his position on the nuclear deal with Iran was consistent with Trump's. He told senators that while "no one disagrees with the ultimate objective" to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, he feels there should be a "full review of that agreement as well as any number of side agreements that are part of that agreement." And he echoed Trump's frequent condemnations of China, calling Beijing's attempts to control airspace and its territorial claims "illegal actions." He said China's construction of artificial islands to further its territorial claims were "akin to Russia's taking of Crimea. It's taking of territory that others lay claim to." Tillerson, who said he hadn't received any classified briefings on the alleged Russian hacks, agreed that it's a "fair assumption" that Putin authorized the attacks. For weeks, Trump has denied or played down Moscow's involvement in efforts to meddle in the US election, although Wednesday, at a press conference Wednesday, Trump said, "I think it was Russia." At the hearing, Democrats -- and some Republicans -- came out swinging. Democrats questioned why in his prepared opening remarks Tillerson didn't mention Russia's alleged hacking of US elections, and they hammered his views on human rights and ExxonMobil's ties to Russia. Rubio started out by probing Tillerson's views on "Is Vladimir Putin a war criminal?" Rubio demanded. "I would not use that term," Tillerson said. "Those are very, very serious charges to make, and I would want to have much more information before reaching a conclusion." Sen. Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, challenged Tillerson on whether his business experience prepares him to represent the US to the world. "Diplomacy is not the same as deal making," Menendez said. He also cited ExxonMobil's membership in a group that lobbied against Iran sanctions and Exxon's pursuit of a deal in Iraqi Kurdistan despite US opposition. And he brought into the hearing room documents showing millions in dollars of Exxon spending against sanctions on Iran and Russia. "What message are you now going to be able to send to American businesses who are intent on pursuing their own interests at the expense of US policies and potential political stability in foreign countries," the New Jersey senator asked. "I have never lobbied against sanctions, personally," Tillerson said. "To my knowledge, Exxon never directly lobbied against sanctions. Not to my knowledge." "There was lobbying here," Menendez told him. "It's a little amazing that you don't know Exxon was lobbying on these issues." Maryland Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin later put into the record documents showing Exxon had spent $3.4 million lobbying against the Iran Sanctions Act. Tillerson also tangled with Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine over long-standing allegations that ExxonMobil misled the public and its investors about internal research that outlined the threat of climate change. The company's shareholders have filed a class action lawsuit against the company in Texas, and it faces a similar lawsuit in Massachusetts as well. "Do you lack the knowledge to answer my question or are you refusing to answer my question?" Kaine challenged the nominee. "A little of both," Tillerson said. "A little of both," Tillerson said. ©Amid a table full of documents, Voting on the Senate budget resolution, the first official step on the road to Obamacare repeal, which begin Wednesday night. The so-called vote-o-rama could carry on past midnight. The repeal itself is several weeks away.

At his news conference Wednesday, Trump said "we've met" with numerous candidates, and indicated he's working off a list of 20 potential nominees he released during the campaign. "I have a list of 20. I have gone through them. We've met with numerous candidates. They're outstanding in every case," Trump said. Transition officials did not say whether Trump himself has met with potential court nominees. "I'll be making the decision on who we will put up ... that will be probably within two weeks of the 20th," Trump said. Later Wednesday, Pence met with Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Joe Donnelly of Indiana in part to try and get them on board for Trump's pick. A Senate Democratic staffer said it was clear Pence is trying to feel out where moderate and vulnerable Democrats are on the nomination fight, as part of a push to get to a filibuster-proof 60 votes. "Today was really about talking about our legislative agenda, but also meeting with members of the Senate to get their input on the President's decision about filling the vacancy on the Supreme Court," Pence told reporters after a series of meetings with senators. Pence also met with former Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine, Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley and GOP Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins. Pence echoed Trump in saying there has not been a selection yet, but they are "winnowing" down the list of potential nominees. The list is made up of mostly federal appellate court judges including Judge William Pryor, Diane Sykes, Steven Colloton, Neil Gorsuch, Raymond Kethledge and Thomas Hardiman. Manchin said he and Pence did not talk about a specific potential nominee, but was told it would be from the list of 20. "If you're a Democrat, you can assume it's going to be somebody conservative. That's a given," Manchin said. "There's been some of the people on that list who have already gone gone through the process here as far as approving. I guess they would look at someone who has gone through, somebody who's made it through here before would have a chance." Such a declaration could cut out Joan Larsen, who sits on the Michigan Supreme Court, rather than the federal bench. It could also mean Trump won't go with the politician previously floated: GOP Sen. Mike Lee of Utah. The Federalist Society's Leonard Leo, Heritage Foundation President Jim DeMint and some senators are involved in the process, Trump said. Sources say that the goal is to get a new justice on the bench by the last sitting of the court which begins on April 17. That would likely require hearings sometime in March. Democrats are gearing up for the hearings and they refer to the seat as being "stolen" by Senate Republicans who declined to hold hearings fro President Obama's nominee Merrick Garland. "Let's see who they nominate," Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said last week to reporters. "If they're in the mainstream we'll give them a very careful look. If they're out of the mainstream we'll oppose them tooth and nail." ©President-elect Donald Trump insisted at a news conference Wednesday that Americans "don't care at all" about his unreleased tax returns. "I'm not releasing the tax returns because, as you know, they're under audit," he said at the event, his first since becoming President-elect. Trump's comment are directly contradicted by most major public polls on the issue. Trump has refused to release his tax returns since declaring his presidential candidacy, arguing that he can't release the information because he is under audit -- an excuse that tax lawyers have said should not prevent him from releasing those documents, even as Trump continues to insist it's the recommendation of his personal counsel. "They've been under audit since the 1970's," a reporter began, but Trump interrupted. "Gee, I've never heard that. I've never heard that. You know, the only one that cares about my tax returns are the reporters, OK? They're the only ones," he said. "You don't think the American public is concerned about it?" the reporter followed up. "No, I don't think so. I won. And became president," Trump said. "No, I don't think they care at all. I don't think they care at all. I think you care." Trump was asked if he would release his tax returns to prove that he doesn't have business and financial ties to Russia that could be used as leverage against him -- a concerning prospect raised by ©CNN political commentator Van Jones says he's suffering from an "emotional whiplash" after President Obama's farewell address and President-elect Donald Trump's first news conference. "My head is completely still spinning," Jones said. "But to be honest, I'm actually skeptical of both of these guys for actually very similar reasons." Jones, who returned as host of "The Messy Truth" series, asked Americans how the country can come together after a divisive and contentious election cycle. In the CNN special, Jones reflected on "the messy truth" of Obama's legacy and a Trump presidency. Jones began with President Obama's final speech, which he called an "amazing celebration of American democracy." But he argued the state of the nation is not so uplifting; the country remains divided. Jones asked if Trump can succeed where Obama failed. He said Trump wants to be the president for everyone, but cites the nomination of Alabama Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions for US attorney general as a stumbling block to unifying the nation. Sessions is "literally terrifying the entire civil rights community," Jones said. Jones added that Americans may need to accept an even bigger, "messier truth." "Donald J. Trump cannot heal our deepest wounds and Barack Obama could not heal our deepest wounds. George W. Bush, William Jefferson Clinton, George H.W. Bush, Ronald Wilson Reagan -- none of our presidents has been able to heal these wounds and bring us together. So maybe, just maybe, the politicians can't solve these problems, maybe we're looking to the wrong people to bridge all these divides and to heal everything. Maybe it's going to be up to 'we the people' to step up ourselves and start fixing this ourselves and start reaching out to each other."

Maybe it's going to be up to 'we the people' to step up ourselves and start fixing this ourselves and start reaching out to each other." ©" That was how Russia rejected claims that it has The gathering of kompromat -- embarrassing material intended to be used against someone -- is a well-known tactic in Russia, according to former British Ambassador to Russia Tony Brenton. "It is very much a part of the way Russia works, that intelligence agencies collect compromising information on individuals and that they'll use it when it's to their advantage," he told CNN. The practice is so widespread that Brenton says British diplomats posted to Russia are warned to be on their guard for it as part of their pre-assignment security briefings. "It is very likely that Russia will collect dossiers of compromising material about US politicians. However, I think it is highly unlikely that these dossiers would find their ways into western hands," he says. James Nixey, head of the Russia and Eurasia program at Chatham House, says the use of financial or sexual kompromat "used to embarrass, expose or keep obedient" began in the Soviet era. "The fact of the matter is most people have a file, most people who have been to Russia of any commercial or political significance have a dossier squirreled away on them," he says. "This is done elsewhere, but it's not leveraged for political or financial gain in the same way as it is in Russia." Igor Sutyagin, senior research fellow at London's Royal United Services Institute, says that to understand kompromat, you must first understand Russia's political culture. "It's standard for Russian politicians to gather kompromat on all members of their inner circle, it's a matter of survival," says Sutyagin. "It's not only possible, it is absolutely normal. Putin grew up in this environment, so it's absolutely natural for him to operate in this way, to gather kompromat." Sex and sexuality has been one of the key areas of exploitation in the past. British civil servant "The Russians ... In his autobiography, "Vassall: The Autobiography of a Spy," he recalled being shown The incriminating pictures, of him "enjoying every possibly sexual activity ... with a number of different men," were used to convince him to spy for the KGB. When Vassall's activities on behalf of the Soviet Union were revealed at the height of the Cold War, the news rocked the British government. Vassall was later sentenced to 18 years in prison. The use of kompromat didn't end with the Cold War and the fall of the Berlin Wall. In 1999, Grainy footage, apparently captured on a concealed camera, showed a Hours after it aired on Russian state television, Skuratov was suspended from his post, despite his protestations -- widely reported at the time -- that " Igor Sutyagin says it was Putin, who was working at the Federal Security Agency (FSB) at the time, who This wasn't the only case in which questions were raised about whether the incriminating material involved was genuine. In 2009, a tape claiming to show Moscow-based Hatcher denied the allegation and the then State Department spokesman Ian Kelly described the "campaign ... to smear a foreign service officer" as deplorable. "Clearly, the video we saw was a montage of lot of different clips, some of them which are clearly fabricated," the then US ambassador John Beyrle told ABC News. While all three of these cases made international headlines, Tony Brenton and James Nixey say most kompromat operates invisibly, with people threatened quietly. "Information is only useful, for the most part, if it's not being used," says Nixey. "The most useful stuff is the stuff we don't hear about, by its very nature." "The very fact that there is a specific Russian word for this" is emblematic of how all-pervading the practise of kompromat is in Russia, he added.

Jeff Jeans of Sedona, Arizona, told Ryan, who is leading the fight in the House to repeal Obamacare, that he had been a small business owner and "lifelong Republican" before being diagnosed with cancer, with just six weeks to live, at age 49. "I want to thank President Obama from the bottom of my heart because I would be dead if it weren't for him," Jeans told Ryan on Thursday night, receiving applause from the audience. He posed a question: "Why would you repeal the Affordable Care Act Without a replacement?" Ryan said Republicans do not plan to repeal the law without better legislation.

'On January 20th, I will not be celebrating or honoring an incoming president who rode racism, sexism, xenophobia and bigotry to the White House," the Democrat said. She went on to highlight Trump's words during the presidential campaign that she characterized as disrespectful to women, immigrants, Muslims and Hispanic Americans.

In contrast with past HUD secretaries, Carson has no government experience or expertise in housing and urban development policy, and Democrats on the Senate Banking committee are expected to question his qualifications to lead the $47 billion agency, which is charged with helping millions of poor Americans secure affordable housing. Instead of a traditional resume, Carson began by highlighting his impoverished upbringing in inner city Detroit and the rags-to-riches success story that he has detailed in books and public appearances in recent years. Carson's family received government assistance in the form of food stamps when he was a child, though he never lived in public housing. If confirmed, Carson would be the only African-American nominated for President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet. In his opening statement to the Senate Banking committee, Carson noted that he was raised by a single mother who had a "third-grade education" and made the case that he understands the issues facing the millions of people who rely on HUD programs. "I have actually in my life understood what housing insecurity was," Carson said, noting that his family moved from Detroit to Boston as a child because they had "no place to live." But Carson faced especially pointed questions about his criticisms of government welfare programs as he looks to be confirmed to lead a government agency that manages many of those initiatives. Carson frequently used his public platform and his presidential run to decry government overreach and drawn on his personal success story to argue against government welfare programs and in favor of a by-the-bootstraps attitude. He has said the government's social welfare programs, including housing subsidies, make the poor "dependent" on the government and has called poverty "really more of a choice than anything else," making a case for personal responsibility. Sen. Sherrod Brown, the top Democrat on the committee, and Sen. Bob Menendez, D-New Jersey, pressed Carson about those criticisms and nudged him to go on the record that he would uphold HUD's mission and that he supports its programs. Carson conceded that he believes HUD's rental assistance program is "essential" and said it would be "cruel and unusual" to retire government assistance programs without a proper replacement. He also assured the committee that he would advocate for HUD's budget and not seek to gut the agency. Carson also committed to ensuring LGBT Americans enjoy equal rights when it comes to HUD programs when pressed on his past controversial statements about that group. The testiest exchange during the hearing came when Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, urged Carson to promise none of HUD's budget would wind up financially benefiting Trump or his real estate company. Carson declined to rule it out, insisting instead that he would "absolutely not play favorites" "I will manage things that benefit the American people," he said, adding he would not unequivocally rule out any HUD funds making their way to the Trump Organization in an appropriate context if such a move would benefit low-income Americans. Warren said she was not raising questions about Carson's integrity but rather about Trump's decision not to place his assets in a blind trust or fully divest from his businesses, instead putting his sons and a top executive in charge of the Trump Organization while he is President. Carson also drew on the connection between housing and health during his confirmation hearing, arguing in his opening statement that his background as a medical professional prepares him for the top HUD post, noting that "good health has a lot to do with a good environment" and that substandard living conditions can result in health problems, including learning disabilities in children. He also looked to quell concerns about his qualifications with a letter from four past HUD secretaries, including a Democrat who served in President Bill Clinton's administration, urging his confirmation. Omarosa Manigault, a former "Apprentice" contestant who oversaw much of Trump's diversity efforts during his campaign and will become White House staff, also sat behind Carson in the second row for part of the hearing. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida -- like Carson a GOP primary rival Trump -- also introduced Carson before the committee, arguing that Carson understands that "HUD is not just about providing people with a place to live. HUDis about the American dream." "Dr. Carson believes this not because he read about it in a book or in a magazine or because he watched some documentary on PBS. He believes it because he has lived it, and that cannot be easily replicated," Rubio said. Although Carson may bring a critical view of government programs to the agency charged with delivering many of those government services, the retired neurosurgeon will also run point on making good of much of Trump's outreach to minority communities during his presidential campaign -- much of which Carson was present for during the campaign. Carson shepherded Trump through inner city Detroit, to a church there and then for a drive through blighted neighborhoods before a brief stop by Carson's childhood home. Trump during his campaign promised to revitalize inner city communities, but frequently conflated his outreach to low-income Americans with outreach to black and brown Americans -- describing a picture of daily life for African-Americans as a blighted war zone filled with crime and poverty. "What the hell do you have to lose?" Trump frequently asked during his campaign rallies, sometimes with Carson close by. Carson served as one of Trump's top surrogates during the campaign, but his interviews on behalf of the brash billionaire candidate sometimes distracted from his surrogacy efforts. In one confrontational exchange on MSNBC, Carson chided a female host amid tough questioning and told her to "stop" before asking her microphone be turned off. He also said there were likely better candidates for president than Trump even after endorsing him. Despite Carson's close relationship with Trump, the retired neurosurgeon nearly didn't join Trump's administration. That's because Democrats aren't the only ones doubting Carson's qualifications to lead the federal department. And Carson confidant Armstrong Williams said at the time that Carson has "never run an agency and that's a lot to ask." "He's a neophyte and that's not his strength," Williams told CNN in November after confirming that Carson had declined Trump's offer to lead the health department.

The announcement, which was expected, comes after criticism of the Justice Department's handling of the investigation, particularly on how the public was notified about the controversy, which was a major issue on the 2016 campaign trail. It will likely mean questions over the role of FBI Director James Comey in the fading days of the election, which Democrats believe helped cost them the presidency, will linger on long into the administration of Donald Trump. Justice Department Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz said the decision to initiate a review was prompted by requests from numerous members of Congress and public inquiries. Horowitz's office said the review will examine several allegations, including that DOJ or FBI policies were not followed when Comey publicly stated last July that his bureau would not pursue criminal charges against Clinton; that DOJ and FBI employees improperly disclosed non-public information; and that the timing of the FBI's release of certain Freedom of Information Act requests right before the election was improper. The White House said Thursday it wasn't involved in the decision to investigate. "Decisions that are made by inspectors general across the administration are independent, and this administration has assiduously protected the independence of inspectors general," White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said at a briefing. A message left with Clinton's office was not immediately returned. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, who chairs the House Oversight Committee, CNN's senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said news of the probe provoked some interesting questions for the new administration, since the tenure of Horowitz, as a political appointee, ends along with the Obama administration ends. "There is a tradition that some presidents allow some inspector generals to stay on and complete. One of the questions that (Trump's nominee for attorney general) Jeff Sessions will surely be asked now ... is will he allow this investigation to continue? Will they appoint a new inspector general?" Toobin told CNN's Brooke Baldwin. "I think we all agree that this is something that is perfect for what inspector generals are supposed to do, but who does this investigation? Does it continue in the new administration? All of that is unsettled right now." Democrats were furious when Comey wrote to lawmakers less than two weeks before the election announcing the discovery of emails potentially relevant to its investigation of Clinton's handling of classified information. The emails, which were found on a laptop, was unearthed as part of a probe into sexting allegations against Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of the Democratic candidate's top aide, Huma Abedin. The move allowed Trump to argue that the investigation against Clinton, which he had used to cast doubt on her character and integrity throughout the campaign, was once again deserving of voters' attention. A few days before the election, Comey wrote to lawmakers again to say that based on a review of emails, the agency had not changed its opinion that Clinton should not face criminal charges. But Democrats say his move came too late and have said that the initial letter stalled her momentum during the final two weeks of the campaign. The FBI's supporters however say Comey had an obligation to inform Congress of an update to his earlier testimony about the case. But Democrats complained that Comey's conduct infringed precedents that dictate that the FBI does everything it can to avoid being drawn into the final stages of a US election. "In fact, to show how awful this situation is, this man ignored precedent that had been going on for decade after decade after decade. The FBI does not get involved in politics -- except Comey did," former Senate Democratic Minority Leader Harry Reid told CNN's Manu Raju in an interview last month. "Had he not written that letter a week or so before the election, she would have won; we would have picked up at least two more Senate seats," he said. The Trump camp has been sensitive to any suggestions that the President-elect's victory in November was not legitimate, a stance it has also adopted to challenge claims by Democrats that alleged Russian hacking of the party's computer servers and emails from the Clinton campaign also influenced the result.

Rosenstein is being picked for a key post to help run the Justice Department under Sen. Jeff Sessions, who is anticipated to win Senate confirmation as attorney general in the coming weeks. Rosenstein is the longest serving US attorney at the Justice Department, having won unanimous Senate confirmation to his current post in 2005 under the administration of President George W. Bush. He's well-regarded in the department and stayed on as the top federal prosecutor in Baltimore under the Obama administration. The then-Democratic-controlled Senate refused to confirm his 2007 nomination to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. Rosenstein declined to comment. Trump has allowed his Cabinet nominees to play a major role in helping fill top positions in their agencies, a strategy past administrations haven't always followed. Sessions, a former US attorney in Alabama, helped choose Rosenstein, transition officials say, in part because of his deep ties to the Justice Department. Despite initial objections by Democrats, Sessions is expected to easily win confirmation. The deputy attorney general leads day-to-day management of the 111,000 employees of the Justice Department. Sessions has plans to make violent crime reduction a major part of his focus. In Baltimore, Rosenstein has pursued strategies to use federal agencies including the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives to help local authorities tackle high crime rates.

He was also Supreme Allied Commander of NATO.

Spicer has also said recently that Trump would not be meeting with any foreign leaders prior to the Inauguration. "Trump Tower is open to the public," he said. Le Pen, who is widely expected to be a front-runner in France's presidential elections this year, has blamed globalization and wide-scale international migration for causing conflicts around the world. She has led the National Front since 2011, attempting to "detoxify" the party somewhat of its reputation for racism and xenophobia, focusing instead on anti-EU and anti-immigration policies.

Ret. Gen. James Mattis also cleared one early procedural hurdle in his confirmation as the Senate voted overwhelmingly in favor of giving him a waiver to a law barring military officials from becoming defense secretary within seven years of their military service. The Senate's 81-17 vote, following the Senate Armed Services Committee's bipartisan 24-3 vote, also signaled Mattis would likely face little opposition to his confirmation. Much of Mattis' hearing focused on areas where Trump and Mattis might diverge in views. At the top of the hearing, Mattis took a hard stance against Russia and Putin in answering a question from anti-Russia hawk, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain. The topic has been one of the greatest sources of Republican criticism of President-elect Donald Trump, who has repeatedly spoken favorably about Putin and for months denied Russia's role in a hacking and misinformation campaign designed to influence the election. "I've watched three presidents commit themselves to new relationships with Vladimir Putin. All three have been an abysmal failure," McCain said, asking Mattis what he would do. "I think right now the most important thing is that we recognize the reality of what we deal with (in) Mr. Putin," Mattis said. "We recognize that he is trying to break the North Atlantic alliance, and that we take the steps, the integrated steps, diplomatic, economic, military and the alliance steps, working with our allies to defend ourselves where we must." He identified Russian aggression, terrorism and Chinese actions in the South China Sea as the biggest security issues since WWII. "I think deterrence is critical right now, sir, absolutely, and that requires a strong military," Mattis said, arguing that the US military is not robust enough right now. He answered similar questions about Moscow from the top Democrat on the committee, Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island. "I'm all for engagement, but we also have to recognize reality and what Russia is up to," Mattis said. "There's a decreasing number of areas where we can engage cooperatively and an increasing number of areas where we're going to have to confront Russia." The topic of NATO was also raised by multiple senators. On the campaign trail, Trump indicated he may reconsider aspects of the US alliance with NATO, alarming lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. Mattis, a former supreme allied commander of NATO, voiced unequivocal support for the alliance and said he had said as much to Trump. "NATO, from my perspective ... is the most successful military alliance certainly in modern world history, probably ever," Mattis said. "I have had discussions with him on this issue. He has shown himself open, even to the point of asking more questions and going deeper into the issue about why I feel so strongly." Later, Mattis was peppered with questions about women and gays in the military from several lawmakers. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, a New York Democrat who has been outspoken on the issue of women in the military and military sexual assault, engaged in a lengthy back-and-forth with Mattis about his position on women and gays in combat -- asking him if he would roll back gains on that front. Mattis repeatedly dodged direct questions about whether he opposes women serving in combat positions or gays in the military, despite Gillibrand reading back his past comments to him. In one case, she quoted a passage in Mattis' book, "Warriors and Citizens," in which he decried the military being subject to societal pressure on causes like women in combat. "We fear that an uninformed public is permitting political leaders to impose an accretion of social conventions that are diminishing the combat power of our military," he and his co-author wrote, as Gillibrand read in the hearing. At the hearing, Mattis responded, "If someone brings me a problem, I'll look at it. But I'm not looking for problems." He continued, "My belief is we have to stay focused on a military so lethal that on a battlefield it will be an enemy's longest day and worst day when they run into that force. ... My concern is with the readiness of the force." He indicated he would come in with a predisposition to not re-open past decisions. "I've never come into any job with an agenda, a pre-formed agenda of changing anything. I come in assuming the people before me deserve respect for the job they did and the decisions they made," Mattis said. His answers also left wiggle room that he could roll back both women in all combat positions and gays serving in the military. Mattis did not answer Gillibrand's question about whether he believes the policies undermine the readiness of the force. "Frankly, senator, I've never cared much about two consenting adults and who they go to bed with," he said. Hawaii Democrat Sen. Mazie Hirono picked up on Gillibrand's thread, asking Mattis if there is "anything innate" in women and gays that would undercut their ability to be part of a lethal force. Mattis simply answered, "No." Mattis also told Missouri Democrat Sen. Claire McCaskill that as long as readiness standards are met, he will not object. "The standards are the standards and when people meet the standards, that's the end of discussion on that," Mattis said. "The reason we're able to maintain an all-volunteer force with very, very high recruiting standards is because we go to males and females. ... Where they can best serve, that's where they go." Mattis is expected to have the votes to be confirmed, as Republicans have a majority in the Senate. An early indicator of Mattis' favor was the overwhelming vote for his waiver. Some of the Democratic lawmakers on the panel foreshadowed their support for the waiver -- saying in fact they backed Mattis as defense secretary precisely as a check on Trump on use of military force. "Let me say very bluntly: If there were ever a case for a waiver of that principle, it is you at this moment in our history," said Connecticut Democrat Sen. Richard Blumenthal. "Your appreciation for the costs of war in blood, treasure and lives, and the impact on veterans afterward, will enable you to be a check on rash and potentially ill-considered use of military force by a President-elect who perhaps lacks that same appreciation." Massachusetts Democrat Elizabeth Warren seemed pleased when she asked Mattis under what circumstances he would be forceful in expressing his views, even when they diverged with the President. "On every circumstance, Senator," Mattis said. Nevertheless, Warren and Blumenthal both voted against the waiver for Mattis in committee. In their opening statements, the top committee Republican and Democrat were both generally favorable to Mattis. "Current law would bar him from serving as secretary of defense for three more years. While I strongly support retaining the law, I also believe that our nation needs Gen. Mattis' service more than ever," said McCain. Reed trained his concerns mainly on Trump, criticizing Putin and praising past statements from Mattis saying the Iran nuclear deal should remain in place unless violated. "You will help oversee national security policy for a president who lacks foreign policy and defense experience, and whose temperament is far different from prior presidents," Reed said. "I think many Americans, and many in this body, on both sides of the aisle, are rightly concerned about how he may respond when he is tested by Russia, Iran, North Korea, and other transnational threats such as cyber." The retired four-star general is a bachelor who spent most of his adult life in the Marines. He served in the first Gulf War and Afghanistan in addition to his positions atop NATO and US Central Command, which is in charge of the US military in the Middle East. While his friends don't call him "Mad Dog," he has earned the nickname in part because of some of his frank comments on the violence that combat sometimes requires. "Be polite, be professional, but have a plan to kill everybody you meet," he would tell his Marines in Iraq, according to Thomas Ricks' book "Fiasco." He also drew criticism for saying in 2005, "It's fun to shoot some people." Of the nickname, which was brought up by New Mexico Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich, Mattis said it was misnomer.

"I am ready to take a position," Merkley, an Oregon Democrat who serves on the Foreign Relations Committee, which heard Tillerson's testimony Wednesday, said in an interview on CNN's "New Day." "I'm going to vote against him, absolutely against him." "It was a very disappointing performance yesterday," he added of Tillerson's day-long confirmation hearing. Merkley said he was disappointed with Tillerson's answers to questions about Russia and his time as CEO of ExxonMobil. "Obviously, sanctions are a big concern -- as leader of Exxon, Tillerson proceeded to utilize a subsidiary to bypass American sanctions on Iran. His company lobbied extensively to get rid of the sanctions and certainly not to extend them," Merkley said, referring to charges that during Tillerson's term as CEO, ExxonMobil skirted US sanctions in international business dealings. Tillerson said during his confirmation hearing Merkley also said he was surprised when Tillerson told the Senate committee that he hadn't discussed Russia policy with President-elect Donald Trump yet. "That has not yet occurred," Tillerson said. "It's inconceivable, because he's been very close to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, the President-elect has been very close to Putin, Exxon had huge interests in Russia. And one of the reasons that you would think that Trump selected him is because he is very close to Putin, and so it didn't seem like he was speaking in a straightforward manner," Merkley said. Still, Merkley said that one has "to give (Tillerson) credit" for his answers about Russian hacking. "I said, 'If a candidate conspired with an outside country to take down your opponent in an internal election, wouldn't this be against the very core of our democratic process?' And he said, 'Yes, yes it would be.' So I have to give Tillerson credit on that one." Republicans have a one-vote margin on the Foreign Relations Committee, meaning that if all Democrats on the panel and just one Republican vote against Tillerson's nomination, it will stall in committee. At least one Republican on the committee, Sen. Marco Rubio, is undecided. However, if the nomination does not make it out of committee, it is still possible for Senate GOP leaders to bring it to a vote before the full Senate, although such a step would be unusual.

James Inhofe defended Donald Trump's comparison of leaking intelligence agencies to Nazi Germany by arguing Thursday the comment showed the President-elect's "sense of humor." Outside the Capitol Hill confirmation hearing for retired Marine Gen. James Mattis, Trump's pick to lead the Defense Department, reporters pressed Inhofe on a number of issues, including whether he is concerned by the President-elect comparing intelligence agencies to Nazi Germany. At first, the Oklahoma Republican denied that Trump said that and said, "You guys, give him a break here." Trump was reacting to leaked news of him and President Barack Obama receiving a report regarding Russian interference in the 2016 US election campaign. According to multiple US officials with direct knowledge of the briefings, a two-page synopsis appended to the report included allegations that Russian operatives claim to have compromising personal and financial information about the President-elect. That synopsis was based on 35 pages of memos prepared by a former British intelligence operative working initially for Republican opponents of Trump, gathering opposition research about him during the presidential campaign, the sources said. The synopsis also included allegations that there was a continuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government, according to two national security officials. "Intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to 'leak' into the public. One last shot at me. Are we living in Nazi Germany?" Trump tweeted Wednesday. After a reporter reminded Inhofe about the tweet, the senator responded: "Sure, those are his words. He has a sense of humor. Isn't that strange?" He added, "Not many people say the things he says but keep in mind, all the things he said, he is still now the nominee, he is going to be president." The Anti-Defamation League, an civil rights organization that combats anti-Semitism, blasted Trump's tweet. "The President-elect's use of Nazi Germany to make a political analogy is not only an inappropriate comparison on the merits, but it also coarsens our discourse and diminishes the horror of the Holocaust," Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the organization, said in a statement Wednesday.

The comments by Biden are the first by any top government official confirming that they were told about the allegations as part of their intelligence briefing. Multiple US officials briefed on the matter told CNN on Thursday that FBI Director James Comey and Trump had a brief one-on-one conversation at last Friday's intelligence briefing. It's during that pull aside that Comey briefed the President-elect on the two-page synopsis of the claims about Trump and Russia. All four intelligence chiefs had decided that Comey would be the one who would handle the sensitive discussion with the President-elect. The discussion was described by the sources as cordial. The FBI declined to comment on this account. Also on Thursday, the two-page synopsis was discussed in a closed-session Senate intelligence briefing, multiple senators told CNN. Intelligence officials said the material was not a product of the intelligence community, an apparent reference to the unverified allegations against Trump. On Wednesday night, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper called Trump to try to defuse tensions after the President-elect accused the intelligence agencies of leaking information about the dossier. He added that the intelligence community "has not made any judgment that the information in this document is reliable, and we did not rely upon it in any way for our conclusions. However, part of our obligation is to ensure that policymakers are provided with the fullest possible picture of any matters that might affect national security."

"So, my sense is that they made the effort, they were unable to do it, but because it was so sensitive, they felt an obligation to present it to the key players," he said. CNN first reported that the nation's top intelligence chiefs provided both the President and President-elect a two-page written synopsis of the claims, which came from a 35-page report compiled by a former British intelligence operative based on Russian sources. Intelligence agencies appended a two-page summary of the unverified allegations to documents prepared for the briefing on Russian meddling in the 2016 US presidential election. Multiple US officials briefed on the matter told CNN on Thursday that FBI Director James Comey and Trump had a brief one-on-one conversation at last Friday's intelligence briefing. It's during that pull aside that Comey briefed the President-elect on the two-page synopsis of the claims about Trump and Russia. All four intelligence chiefs had decided that Comey would be the one who would handle the sensitive discussion with the President-elect. The discussion was described by the sources as cordial. The FBI declined to comment on this account. The memos originated as opposition research, first commissioned by anti-Trump Republicans, and later by Democrats. At this point, CNN is not reporting on details of the memos, as it has not independently corroborated the specific allegations. But, in preparing this story, CNN has spoken to multiple high ranking intelligence, administration, congressional and law enforcement officials, as well as foreign officials and others in the private sector with direct knowledge of the memos. Panetta defended still including the information in briefings, saying, "The reason I think it was included, Erin, is because it's very sensitive information, even though it's unsubstantiated and uncorroborated. The fact is that it is extremely sensitive and I think the problem is that the intelligence agencies would have felt that they would be at fault if they didn't bring that to the attention of the principals." He added that "this is what happens in intelligence briefings" and "it's important to bring it to the attention of the key people so that they know this information is out there." Panetta would not say whether or not he believes the unsubstantiated claims yet, adding "I think this is the kind of report that really does require that you got to look at a number of different sources to see whether or not it really is true." ©Former CIA Director Leon Panetta said Thursday that Rep. Mike Pompeo, whom President-elect Donald Trump has picked to lead the agency, is up to the task and supports his nomination. "He's somebody who understands the intelligence agencies, is smart and I think will be a good director," Panetta told CNN's Erin Burnett on "OutFront." Panetta, who later served as President Barack Obama's secretary of defense, has made similarly positive comments about defense secretary nominee James Mattis.

Pompeo, a Kansas Republican, ©Marco Rubio is back in the thick of it. The Florida Republican, who reversed his decision to quit the Senate after his losing the GOP presidential nomination, suddenly finds himself at the center of the political intrigue swirling around Donald Trump's nascent administration. Rubio's tough questioning Wednesday of Rex Tillerson, Trump's pick for secretary of state, and unresolved doubts about the former ExxonMobil chief's nomination, present him with a set of provocative political choices. The senator was expected to meet Tillerson on Thursday after expressing reservations over the potential top US diplomat's answers on Russia, the Philippines and Saudi Arabia -- particularly on human rights -- "We're still working through it, so you know, we'll have a decision here soon," Rubio told CNN on Thursday. In some ways, Rubio's position at the center of the Tillerson confirmation drama validates his decision to return to the Senate. At the time, the Florida senator argued that his deep interest in foreign policy and the clutch of threats to US national security justified his decision to reverse his resolve to turn his back on Washington. The Tillerson confirmation process gives him immediate platform to shape the course of the new administration's foreign policy. In a baser sense, it also offers him an opening to exact revenge: a decision to slow or stall the Tillerson nomination would poke Trump in the eye. That might be a temptation for Rubio after he saw his presidential dreams crushed last year by the billionaire who ridiculed him as "Little Marco" during the bitter primary race. Rubio could complicate Tillerson's nomination fight by declining to back him in a Senate Foreign Relations Committee vote. Assuming all of the panel's Democrats also oppose him, that would force Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to resort to some legislative gymnastics to bring the nomination to the full Senate. Such a step would position Rubio as an early -- and likely irredeemable -- critic of Trump administration foreign policy, particularly the President-elect's determination to repair estranged US relations with the Kremlin. But coming out against Tillerson would also threaten to diminish Rubio's future capacity to influence Trump's foreign policy from the Senate since he would immediately become persona non grata for the new administration. A decision to come out against Tillerson would effectively see Rubio line up with Senate GOP foreign policy hawks like John McCain and Lindsey Graham. Like Rubio, McCain and Graham have yet to decide on whether to back Tillerson. Given the narrow GOP Senate majority, a decision by the trio to oppose him could doom the nomination, should all of the 48 Democrats in the Senate band together in opposition. Rubio has come under intense implied pressure from establishment Republicans who are backing Tillerson, including former defense secretary Robert Gates and former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice. Alienating that establishment could hurt Rubio if he hopes to one day advance in national politics. Apart from his shaky performance in Wednesday's hearing, Tillerson came across as a down-the-line establishment Republican foreign policy type who is far more conventional on key questions than the President he will serve if he is confirmed. That means Rubio has to consider whether alienating the establishment national security wing of the GOP would erode the foreign policy sway on which he has anchored his second Senate term. He might also conclude that if Tillerson were to fail, Trump could nominate someone more in line with his own foreign policy beliefs and farther from the Republican mainstream. These concerns aside, there appears to be a more fundamental reason for Rubio's concern about Tillerson -- one that is often dismissed in the cynicism of Washington. It may well be a question of principle. Rubio's questions to Tillerson on Wednesday were consistent with the way he has approached foreign policy throughout his career. He took exception to Tillerson taking refuge in the fact that he had not yet had classified briefings on many human rights questions, judging that the nominee fell short of the sharp moral clarity Rubio believes should underpin America's engagement with the world. The son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio has often viewed America's foreign policy through the prism of human rights and a deep antipathy towards communism and authoritarian governments. He has spoken out in favor of Chinese dissidents, branded Russian President Vladimir Putin a "gangster" and pushed for democratic reforms in the Western Hemisphere in particular. He told Tillerson on Wednesday he had no questions about his character or patriotism, but was troubled that he was unable to label Putin a war criminal, condemn thousands of extra-judicial killings in the Philippines under President Rodrigo Duterte's anti-drugs purge or to judge that Russian bombings of Syrians in formerly rebel-held districts of Aleppo amounted to war crimes. "The position that you've been nominated to is, in my opinion, the second most important position in the US government, with all due respect to the vice president," Rubio told Tillerson. "It is the face of this country for billions of people, for hundreds of millions of people as well, and particularly, for people that are suffering and they're hurting." "We need a secretary of state that will fight for these principles," Rubio said. "We need a secretary of state that will fight for these principles," Rubio said. ©President-elect Donald Trump's choice for Defense Secretary, Ret. Gen. James Mattis, faced a series of rapid-fire questions at his confirmation hearing Thursday about the Middle East from Republican South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, a big player on military issues. Graham put Mattis on the spot, asking what the capital of Israel is. "The capital of Israel that I go to, sir, is Tel Aviv, sir, because that's where all their government people are," Mattis said. Israel's military officials are primarily based in Tel Aviv, but the rest of the national government is located in Jerusalem. Many Republicans have long pushed for the US to recognize the capital of Israel as Jerusalem, a move seen by past administrations on both sides as inflammatory to Palestinians and Arabs if done outside of a peace agreement. Trump has pledged to move the US Embassy to Jerusalem as president, and his nominee for ambassador to Israel is a vocal advocate of such a move. "Sir, right now I go with US policy," Mattis said when asked whether he would support moving the embassy. "I would defer to the nominee of Secretary of State on that, sir." Mattis also said he supports a two-state solution for the Israel-Palestinian conflict if it promotes peace, but that he would be open to other solutions. Graham also peppered Mattis with questions about the Iran nuclear deal. Mattis has said he intends to let the deal stand unless there is a violation. "It's not a deal I would have signed, sir," Mattis said. He said he would ask Congress to have a joint committee to oversee the implementation of the accord, boost intelligence community monitoring and have "a combined missile defense, air and missile defense capability, for our Gulf allies." He appeared to displease Graham when he said he supports sanctions when they are supported internationally, prompting Graham to ask him if he's giving the world a "veto" on US sanctions. "I would never give the world a veto," Mattis said.

Mike Pompeo, Donald Trump's pick for CIA director, promised Thursday at his Senate confirmation hearing to deliver unvarnished facts to the President and pledged to shield the agency from political influence at a time when Trump has been critical of the intelligence community. Like other nominees this week, the Kansas Republican disagreed with the President-elect in tone and substance on several occastions. He vowed not to reinstate enhanced interrogation techniques -- even if ordered to do so by Trump -- and took a harder line on Russia than Trump has displayed. Pompeo opened the hearing with criticism of Moscow even as the President-elect has suggested that the intelligence community's findings of Russian meddling in last year's election were overblown. Pompeo told the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that he embraced those findings as spelled out in a comprehensive report of the intelligence community on the Russian breaches compiled earlier this month. "With respect to this report in particular, it's pretty clear about what took place here, about Russian involvement in efforts to hack information and to have an impact on American democracy," he said in response to questioning. "This was an aggressive action taken by senior leadership inside of Russia." He added that Russia would view the debate it has sparked in the US as something that would be "to their benefit." In his opening remarks, Pompeo listed Russia as well as China as "sophisticated adversaries" in the cyber realm, saying "hackers are all taking advantage of this new borderless environment" and "the CIA must continue to be at the forefront of this issue." In other criticism of Russia, he said the country has "reasserted itself aggressively, invading and occupying Ukraine, threatening Europe, and doing nothing to aid in the destruction and defeat of ISIS." His words were more aggressive toward Moscow than Trump's have been, continuing a theme evident throughout the confirmation hearings this week in which the President-elect's nominees have seemed more wary of the traditional American foe than their would-be boss. Pompeo pledged that the the CIA would provide policymakers with "accurate, timely, robust and clear-eyed analysis of Russian activities." Along with Russia, Pompeo said other global threats include Iran's growing influence in the Middle East, ISIS's grip over major urban areas and the conflict in Syria. "This is the most complicated threat environment the United States has seen in recent memory," he said. The hearing moved Thursday afternoon to a closed session. Along with the hot-button issue of Russian hacking, Pompeo confronted a number of other controversial topics, chief among them the issue of torture. When questioned Thursday, Pompeo said he would not restart the CIA's use of enhanced interrogation techniques if he is approved for the position. Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein asked, if ordered by President-elect Trump, whether he would restart the CIA's use of enhanced interrogation tactics the that fall outside of the Army Field Manual. "Absolutely not," Pompeo responded. "Moreover, I can't imagine I would be asked that by the President-elect." Later in the hearing, Pompeo was asked by Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico if he would commit that to complying with the law and acknowledge that the CIA is out of the enhanced interrogation business. "Yes, you have my full commitment," Pompeo said. The congressman has in the past appeared to agree with Trump on the topic, the latter of whom said he would "absolutely" bring back waterboarding, as well as methods "a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding." In response to "These men and women are not torturers, they are patriots. The programs being used were within the law, within the Constitution, and conducted with the full knowledge of Sen. Feinstein," he said. "If any individual did operate outside of the program's legal framework, I would expect them to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law." Two of Trump's other nominees -- Jeff Sessions for attorney general and John Kelley for the Department of Homeland Security -- earlier in the week And retired Gen. David Petraeus, also a former CIA director, Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said in his opening statement that he's been "concerned" by rhetoric from Trump. Warner continued that the CIA "and the entire intelligence community has been repeatedly and unfairly subjected to criticisms of its integrity." "These comments have affected the morale of these dedicated men and women," he said. "Today, I would like to hear your plan to reassure CIA employees that those countless hours they commit, and the operations where they may be called upon to put their life on the line, are not in vain, and that their sacrifices will not be disregarded in the White House, or anywhere else in the next administration." Warner's opening statement was interrupted by a power outage at the hearing that put the session into temporary recess. Trump agreed Wednesday for the first time with the intelligence community's assessment that Kremlin was behind the hacking. "I think it was Russia," he said, after weeks of criticizing the intelligence community's findings, including a series of tweets this week accusing them of leaking allegations that tie Trump to Russia. "Intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to 'leak' into the public. One last shot at me. Are we living in Nazi Germany?" he tweeted Wednesday. Asked in his first news conference after his election if he trusts intelligence agencies, Trump said they are "vital and very, very important" but didn't explicitly say he had faith in their information. Instead, he pointed to his own nominees like Pompeo, and former Sen. Dan Coats for director of national intelligence, as forward-looking examples of how his administration will address the hacking scandal. "Within 90 days, they're going to be coming back to me with a major report on hacking," Trump said. "I want them to cover this situation." Pompeo's hearing comes just two days after the same committee grilled the nation's top intelligence officials, including current CIA Director John Brennan, FBI Director James Comey, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and National Security Agency Director Michael S. Rogers. The officials said that the highest levels of the Russian government ordered the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and other state-level organizations in an attempt to sow doubt about the country's electoral process and to discredit Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Old domains of the Republican National Committee were also hacked, Comey said, but there was no evidence that the current RNC or the Trump campaign were successfully penetrated. As CIA director, Pompeo will be involved with evaluating Iran's compliance with its agreement to curb its nuclear program. While he opposed the deal in Congress, he vowed to continue to keep up the CIA's monitoring of the situation, whatever the information gleaned indicates. "Iranians are professionals at cheating," he said. On social issues, Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris of California brought up Pompeo's opposition to same-sex marriage and asked if he would promise not to discriminate against LGBT employees of the CIA. "You have my full commitment to that," he said. Harris also brought up comments by John Brennan, the current CIA director, who said analysts have found climate change to be a deeper cause of "rising instability" in certain parts of the world. Pompeo said he stands by his past skepticism of climate change but promised to relay any intelligence gathered that's related to the "changes in climatic activity." Pompeo graduated first in his class from the US Military Academy at West Point and served in the US Army from 1986-1991. He was stationed in Germany for a time as a cavalry officer patrolling the Iron Curtain, according to his congressional bio. He then graduated from Harvard Law School, where he was an editor at the Harvard Law Review. Returning to Kansas, he began a career in business, heading up companies that manufactured and provided materials for aircraft and oilfields. In Congress, he has built a reputation as a conservative stalwart on national security issues. In particular, he was known as a hardliner on the Select Committee on Benghazi, a panel that he felt was not hard enough on Clinton for the actions of the State Department she then headed in responded to attacks that resulted in the death of four Americans. He co-authored a lengthy addendum to the committee's findings in which he blasted Clinton for "a tragic failure of leadership" and accused the Obama administration of trying to cover up the true nature of the Benghazi attack. When Trump publicly announced Pompeo as his choice, the congressman received some praise from Democrats, including Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, who said Pompeo is "someone who is willing to listen and engage, both key qualities in a CIA director."

Warning that the Affordable Care Act was in a "death spiral," House Speaker Paul Ryan said at a news conference Thursday that Republicans have a responsibility to repeal and replace Obamacare as quickly as possible. "We've got to intervene to prevent this from getting worse," Ryan said. Following Donald Trump's comments this week that the party must repeal and replace "simultaneously," Ryan insisted that GOP leaders and the President-elect are "in complete sync." However, Ryan would not offer a firm timeline on when a final repeal bill would land on Trump's desk. "We're not holding hard deadlines only because we want to get it right." Ryan is facing concerns about the first step of repeal from members who represent the ideological spectrum of the Republican conference. A significant chunk of conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus -- as many as 20 members -- are leaning against the measure. Some of those want assurances from the leadership that the process to replace the law will occur quickly alongside the votes to repeal it. Other conservatives are disappointed that the budget resolution doesn't include the broader spending cuts they want to demonstrate their commitment to shrinking government. Members of the more moderate "Tuesday group" have expressed concerns about backing a repeal effort without more details in place on GOP plans to replace Obamacare and a sufficient transition period so that there aren't disruptions. House GOP leadership aides continue to express confidence that they have broad support for the measure. "We're looking forward to a good vote on Friday," Chris Bond, spokesman for House Majority Whip Steve Scalise told CNN, saying that leaders continue to have conversations with members, and there is no talk of delaying the vote. Ryan also stressed Friday's House vote on the budget resolution is a "procedural vote" to start the process of repealing Obamacare. "We're going to do this the way Congress is supposed to work, but we do need to move quickly," Ryan said, adding that the Trump administration will be able to provide "regulatory relief" in the meantime as well. The Senate passed the so-called "repeal resolution" 51-48 in an overnight vote. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Thursday detailed the path forward. "The next step will then be the legislation to finally repeal Obamacare and move us toward smarter health policies. The repeal legislation will include a stable transition period as we work toward patient-centered health care," McConnell said on the Senate floor Thursday. "We plan to take on the replace challenge in manageable pieces with step-by-step reforms," he added. "We can begin to make important progress within that repeal legislation, and we'll continue to work with the incoming administration and the House in developing what comes next." But the last-minute internal lobbying shows how much more difficult the process of dismantling the law is proving to be, even with Republicans in control of both chambers of Congress and Trump about to be sworn in. House Republicans voted multiple times over the past two years to repeal all or parts of Obamacare, but faced with presenting details for what will come next is causing some to be nervous about the process. Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows told reporters on Wednesday he is undecided on how he will vote on the measure, but the group of conservatives is split. Without enough of its members agreeing on a position the caucus will not take an official position. One factor that is helping House GOP leaders is that two outside conservative advocacy groups -- Heritage Action and the Club For Growth -- are "scoring" the vote, meaning they are using the vote as a way to keep tabs on how members vote on key issues. Fiscal conservatives in the Republican Study Committee are pressing for their own budget to be added as an amendment ahead of Friday's vote, a move to go on record with their concerns. "This budget is not the road map to fiscal responsibility House conservatives would have preferred," RSC Chairman Mark Walker told CNN in a written statement. The North Carolina Republican said it was important to move ahead with the resolution to fulfill a pledge to repeal Obamacare but added, "we must immediately act to ensure that the FY 2018 budget balances and brings America's fiscal house in order" saying the push to add his plan was a "marker" to begin that process. But likely the bigger issue that will propel some wavering members is that Trump has publicly called for repealing and replacing Obamacare to be a top priority for the early days of his administration. Another big question that some conservative House Republicans are pressing Ryan for clarity on, according to a GOP aide, is whether Obamacare taxes -- which include taxes on high-income Americans and insurers and other providers -- would be repealed immediately as a part of the budget reconciliation bill. Many conservatives who want smaller government and less taxes are advocating for an immediate repeal of the taxes in the Affordable Care Act. But others worry that that money is necessary to fund the GOP's replacement plan. ©President Barack Obama was spotted bidding farewell to members of his White House staff Thursday as his administration winds down. Obama spoke to about 100 staffers gathered on the steps of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building inside the White House complex. Cameras couldn't pick up his comments, but his team laughed and cheered as he addressed them. After he finished, Obama posed for a photo and stood to shake each of his staff members' hands. Obama is wrapping up his eight years in office, including saying thanks to his team at the White House, as well as those who voted for him. "For eight years -- and for some of you, a whole lot more -- I have drawn from your energy, and every day I tried to reflect back what you displayed -- heart, and character, and idealism," Obama said during his farewell address on Tuesday night in Chicago. "I've watched you grow up, get married, have kids, start incredible new journeys of your own." "Even when times got tough and frustrating, you never let Washington get the better of you," he went on. "You guarded against cynicism. And the only thing that makes me prouder than all the good that we've done is the thought of all the amazing things that you're going to achieve from here."

House lawmakers have been squaring off on the artwork, which Democratic Rep. William Lacy Clay re-hanged three times Tuesday after several Republican lawmakers pulled it down, criticizing it as being anti-police. The painting by high school student David Pulphus won Clay's congressional art competition last May. Ryan, speaking in a radio interview on the Mike Gallagher Show, dismissed questions that removal of the painting restricts the artist's First Amendment rights. "This isn't a question of First Amendment rights. Of course this young person has the right to do something like this wherever they want to," Ryan said. "But we do have rules that govern these paintings, so it's not as if you have a constitutional right to hang whatever you want in the House hallway in the Capitol gallery." Ryan's colleague, GOP Rep. Dave Reichert, a former Seattle sheriff, sent a detailed letter to the architect of the Capitol with the rules for Capitol artwork on Wednesday, which does not allow subjects of "contemporary political controversy or a sensationalistic or gruesome nature." Ryan acknowledged that the painting "slipped by" when it was first hung. "This is not a free-for-all, you know, contest, where anything goes in the Capitol. There are rules that govern this. We see that this does not fit the rules, and so we are processing that decision right now," the House speaker said. Asked whether he is confident the painting will ultimately come down, Ryan said, "I am."

Here are the top things he said on Thursday evening to CNN's Jake Tapper: "The law is collapsing, and so we've got to rescue people." "We want to do this at the same time, and in some cases in the same bill." "I can see that you love your daughter and you're a nice person who has a great future ahead of you, and I hope your future's here," Ryan told an undocumented woman who asked if she would be deported. "I'm here to tell you, in Congress, it's not happening," Ryan responded, when reminded that Trump promised a "deportation force" on the presidential campaign trail. "He did it to me all the time during the campaign. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say this is going to be a very unconventional president." "I actually do know what a dab is," he said, recalling the moment this month when a congressman's son confused him by performing the viral move in a photo with the speaker. "I thought he was sneezing." "You don't have these controversies by funding health centers." "What if you want to become an advocate for the cancer society?" Ryan asked, questioning the need for ultra-tough restrictions on congressional insiders. "What's wrong with them advocating for causes that they believe in?" "I think it has been politicized," Ryan said of the intelligence community, agreeing with Trump. "I completely understand why he's frustrated." "Russia is a global menace led by a man who is menacing. Vladimir Putin does not share our interests. He frustrates our interests." "Russia is a global menace led by a man who is menacing. Vladimir Putin does not share our interests. He frustrates our interests." ©House Speaker Paul Ryan said Thursday Republicans plan to repeal President Barack Obama's health care law at the same time they approve a GOP replacement plan. "We want to do this at the same time, and in some cases in the same bill," Ryan said during a town hall in Washington sponsored by CNN and moderated by Jake Tapper. "So we want to advance repealing this law with its replacement at the same time." Ryan said Republicans are moving "as quickly as they can" to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, but said he doesn't yet have a date, and it will take "a little bit of time" to do so. "We're working on this as fast as possible," he said, adding that the GOP will act "definitely within these first 100 days" of Trump's presidency. Ryan's comments align the speaker with President-elect Donald Trump, who said at a At the outset of the town hall, Ryan didn't say that the government has an obligation to insure every American. "I clearly think there's a role for the government in health care, no doubt about it," the Wisconsin Republican said. He added that he supports elements of the health care law -- including that "people with pre-existing conditions, no matter how much money they make," should have access to insurance. But, he said, "The law is collapsing, and so we've got to rescue people." Ryan faces a tough balancing act as he leads the House at the outset of Trump's administration. He's attempting to hold together an unruly set of Republicans that includes Trump loyalists who want to see the President-elect's populist policies swiftly enacted, fiscal hawks who fret about the price tag of those policies and moderates still leery of the President-elect. Meanwhile, Democrats appear set to deny the GOP even limited support on any major initiatives. Ryan, who waited weeks to even endorse Trump after he clinched the GOP nomination, also now knows his party's electoral fate is largely tied to his ability to help Trump succeed. And he remains committed to his own, much more detailed policy platform, years in the making. Ryan had long sought a Republican president to sign his entitlement reforms and budget cuts into law -- but hadn't counted on this Republican president. Ryan was asked point-blank by a woman whose parents brought her to the US as an undocumented immigrant at age 11, and who has remained in the country for 21 years since: "Do you think that I should be deported?" "I can see that you love your daughter and you're a nice person who has a great future ahead of you, and I hope your future's here," Ryan responded. Trump has pledged to repeal Obama's executive actions that allowed undocumented immigrants brought into the country as children and their families to remain in the country without fear of deportation. Ryan said lawmakers are talking with Trump's transition team about those immigrants -- and said Trump's focus is on violent criminals and building a US-Mexico border wall. "That's the problem he wants to focus on. This is not the focus. And so what we have to do is find a way to ensure that you can get right with the law," he said. "We have to figure out how to fix this, but to do that, people need to have confidence that our laws are being followed, people know who's coming and going and we need to have a secure border." "What we have to do is figure out how to have a humane solution to this very legitimate, sincere problem, and respect the rule of law," Ryan said. Tapper asked Ryan if Republicans would seek a law barring the federal government from using information submitted by those allowed to remain in the US through Obama's executive actions to deport those individuals. Ryan responded that though some fear a deportation force, "it's not happening." Tapper responded that Trump had actually talked of creating a "deportation force" on the campaign trail. "I know, I know," Ryan said, laughing. "But I'm here to tell you, in Congress, it's not happening." He did, however, take a hard line on "sanctuary cities" that don't deport undocumented immigrants. "Sanctuary cities are a violation of the rule of law, and they are not to be tolerated," he said. "That means if you want federal assistance, you're not going to get it. You've got to enforce the law," Ryan said, referring to cities that adopt such policies. Ryan took a tough line on Russia, saying the United States must "step up our game" and adopt a "stronger Russia engagement policy, for sure, across the board." "The fact that a foreign government tried to meddle in another government's election is wrong," Ryan said, calling for stronger sanctions against the country. He called Russia a "global menace led by a man who is menacing." "Vladimir Putin does not share our interests," Ryan said. "He frustrates our interests. He violates his neighbors. ... He's not democratic. I really think a lot of the things that he is doing is to try to delegitimize the other democracies so that his illegitimate democracy doesn't look as illegitimate by comparison." That's a contrast to Trump, who has praised Putin, the Russian president. The President-elect acknowledged at the Wednesday news conference that he thought Russia was responsible for the hack but blamed poor cybersecurity at the Democratic National Committee and said Putin wouldn't take such actions under a Trump administration. Ryan said he believes intelligence -- including a two-page summary of unverified claims that Russian operatives claim to have compromising personal and financial information about Trump -- that Still, he defended the intelligence community, saying of Trump: "I think he's going to learn that there are a lot of good men and women in the intelligence community who risk their lives to keep us safe." But, in a nod to Trump's complaints that some news organizations published the uncorroborated details, Ryan said: "I completely understand why he's frustrated that eight, nine days before his inauguration, this junk gets thrown out there." CNN has not published or aired any of the uncorroborated details from the memo. The speaker was pressed at the town hall on the GOP's push to block Planned Parenthood from receiving federal health care dollars for services provided to women because the organization provides abortions -- even though abortions are not covered by taxpayer dollars. "We don't want to commit taxpayer funding for abortion, and Planned Parenthood is the largest abortion provider," he said. Tapper pressed Ryan, noting that existing law blocks taxpayer dollars from funding abortions. But, Ryan argued, "money's fungible, and it effectively floats these organizations." He said Republicans would rather shift those dollars -- and redirect Planned Parenthood's patients using those dollars -- to federal community health centers. "You don't have these controversies by funding health centers," he said. The vast majority of federal money that Planned Parenthood does receive funds preventive health care, birth control, pregnancy tests, and other women's health care services. Ryan said he doesn't expect Trump to get off Twitter when he moves into the White House -- and he doesn't know how the President-elect's social media use will affect foreign and domestic policy. "I think he's going to keep doing this, and I think he's going to be probably a little more restrained in his tweets probably, but it's all relative," Ryan said. "But I do believe it's been extremely effective for getting elected president, I've got to tell you. He was able to touch and tap into people's hearts and minds." Ryan joked about his own viral sensation -- when a "I actually do know what a dab is," he said to laughter. But, he said, the young man was dabbing incorrectly. "I thought he was sneezing."

"I can see that you love your daughter and you're a nice person who has a great future ahead of you, and I hope your future's here," Ryan responded during a President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to repeal President Barack Obama's executive actions that allowed undocumented immigrants brought into the country as children and their families to remain in the country without fear of deportation. Ryan said lawmakers are talking with Trump's transition team about those immigrants -- and said Trump's focus is on violent criminals and building a US-Mexico border wall. "That's the problem he wants to focus on. This is not the focus. And so what we have to do is find a way to ensure that you can get right with the law," he said. "We have to figure out how to fix this, but to do that, people need to have confidence that our laws are being followed, people know who's coming and going and we need to have a secure border." "What we have to do is figure out how to have a humane solution to this very legitimate, sincere problem, and respect the rule of law," Ryan said. Tapper asked Ryan if Republicans would seek a law barring the federal government from using information submitted by those allowed to remain in the US through Obama's executive actions to deport those individuals. Ryan responded that though some fear a deportation force, "it's not happening." Tapper responded that Trump had actually talked of creating a "deportation force" on the campaign trail. "I know, I know," Ryan said, laughing. "But I'm here to tell you, in Congress, it's not happening." He did, however, take a hard line on "sanctuary cities" that don't deport undocumented immigrants. "Sanctuary cities are a violation of the rule of law, and they are not to be tolerated," he said. "That means if you want federal assistance, you're not going to get it. You've got to enforce the law," Ryan said, referring to cities that adopt such policies. "That means if you want federal assistance, you're not going to get it.

During an exchange with New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, the retired ExxonMobil CEO said that a conversation about Russia between himself and Trump had "not yet occurred" and that the two had only discussed global affairs in general terms. "That's pretty amazing," Menendez responded. Tillerson's statement came a day after CNN reported classified documents were presented last week to President Barack Obama and Trump that included allegations that Russian operatives claim to have compromising personal and financial information about Trump. Tillerson has come under scrutiny for his relationship with Russia, having once received the Order of Friendship award from President Vladimir Putin, one of the highest honors Russia gives to foreign citizens. However, during his hearing, Tillerson took a tougher line on Russia than Trump has during the campaign and the transition. "Russia must know that we will be accountable to our commitments and those of our allies, and that Russia must be held to account for its actions," he said. Tillerson also denied that ExxonMobil had ever lobbied against sanctions placed on Russia, despite "I never lobbied against the sanctions. To my knowledge, ExxonMobil never lobbied against the sanctions," he said. "I never lobbied against the sanctions.

Jeff Sessions' nomination for attorney general. "After reviewing his record and giving careful consideration to his answers during the hearing, I am not confident in Senator Sessions' ability to be a defender of the rights of all Americans, or to serve as an independent check on the incoming administration," the New York Democrat said in a statement. "I am also deeply concerned by his views on immigration, which I saw firsthand during the push for comprehensive immigration reform. For those reasons, I will oppose his nomination to serve as the next attorney general." Schumer said the next attorney general must have a proven track record in fighting for the rights of all Americans. "The attorney general must wake up every single day ensuring the rights of all Americans: immigrants, minorities, young and old, gay and straight, disabled and not are protected," he said. "Every right -- freedom of speech, freedom of religion, the freedom to vote, or any other enshrined in our Constitution or the law -- must be protected for every American." Multiple civil rights groups, along with Democratic lawmakers, have expressed concern about Sessions' ability to represent historically disenfranchised groups given his past statements on the Voting Rights Act, the NAACP and allegations of racist language, which he has denied. "Senator Sessions has failed to convince me that he will be a champion of constitutional rights: voting rights, women's health care and privacy rights, and anti-discrimination protections. Rather, he has demonstrated hostility and antipathy -- even downright opposition -- to these bedrock Constitutional principles," Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut, said in a statement Thursday announcing his opposition to Sessions. Sen. Cory Booker -- who, in an unprecedented move for a sitting senator, testified against Sessions on Wednesday -- told CNN's Manu Raju Wednesday that his opposition to Sessions is due to the Alabama senator's criticism of the Justice Department's handling of issues such as police accountability, violence against women and voter rights. "Jeff Sessions is out of line even with the Republican caucus," the New Jersey Democrat said. "While everybody, from (Senate Judiciary Committee) Chairman (Chuck) Grassley to Ted Cruz, Mike Lee, are all working together on issues around criminal justice reform, this is somebody who's criticized those very reforms." Civil rights icon and Georgia Rep. John Lewis, who also testified against Sessions on Wednesday, called into question his commitment to being an advocate for Americans who have experienced discrimination. "We need someone who is going to stand up, speak up and speak out for the people who need help, for the people who have been discriminated against," said Lewis, who marched for voting rights during the Civil Rights Movement.

But after about eight hours of testimony, there was more clarity on some -- but not all -- of Tillerson's views: "Russia today poses a danger, but it is not unpredictable in advancing its own interests ... I think the important conversation that we have to have with them is, does Russia want to now and forever be an adversary of the United States? We're not likely to ever be friends." "We simply cannot back away from our commitment" to reduce nuclear weapons. "I don't think I will be telling the boss how he ought to communicate the American people. That's going to be his choice ... It would be my expectation that any way the president might choose to communicate through whatever method would be supportive of that policy we both agreed on." "The risk of climate change does exist and the consequences of it could be serious enough that actions should be taken ... I don't see it as the imminent national security threat that perhaps others do." "No one disagrees with the ultimate objective" of the deal -- to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. Tillerson said he and Trump want to "do a full review of that agreement as well as any number of side agreements that I understand are part of that agreement." "We have to step back and look at all of China's activities ... They are taking territory or declaring control of territories that are not rightfully China's ... akin to Russia's taking of Crimea. It's taking of territory that others lay claim to."xc2xa0 "Mexico is a longstanding neighbor and friend of this country."

Just before 1:30 a.m. Thursday morning, weary senators headed to the exits of the Capitol, having voted along party lines for a measure that paves the way for an Obamacare repeal. ©Donald Trump's pick for CIA director said Thursday he would not restart the CIA's use of enhanced interrogation techniques if he were approved for the position. Rep. Mike Pompeo, "Absolutely not," Pompeo responded. "Moreover, I can't imagine I would be asked that by the President-elect." Later in the hearing, Pompeo was asked by Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico if he would commit to complying with the law and acknowledge that the CIA is out of the enhanced interrogation business. "Yes, you have my full commitment," Pompeo said. Pompeo has previously supported the use of enhanced interrogation techniques publicly in Congress. In response toxc2xa0the 2014 Senate report that found the CIA tortured suspected terrorists, Pompeo, as a congressman, released a statement saying the methods used were constitutional. "These men and women are not torturers, they are patriots. The programs being used were within the law, within the Constitution, and conducted with the full knowledge of Sen. Feinstein," he said. "If any individual did operate outside of the program's legal framework, I would expect them to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law." Pompeo's position against torture techniques at the hearing falls in line with those of other Trump nominees testifying this week. Secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson, homeland security nominee retired Gen. John Kelly and attorney general nominee Jeff Sessions all rejected the practice during their hearings on Tuesday and Wednesday, putting them at odds with Trump's campaign rhetoric. In his confirmation hearing Tuesday, Kelly said he would "absolutely" abide by US laws prohibiting the use of waterboarding and other forms of torture. That was a break with Trump's campaign promise to bring back waterboarding and "worse" forms of torture in the fight against terrorism. Sessions also split with Trump's views on waterboarding. He emphasized that Congress has outlawed the practice since it was used in the aftermath of the 9/11 terror attacks during the George W. Bush administration. "Congress has taken an action now that makes it absolutely improper and illegal to use waterboarding or any other form of torture in the United States by our military and by all our other departments and agencies," he said. During Tillerson's hearing before the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts asked if Tillerson agreed with his fellow Cabinet nominees, including Sessions, that torture would not be recommended to Trump. "Well I think others have opined on that sufficiently, and I wouldn't disagree with what they've said," Tillerson responded. "I would agree with what they've said."

The raucous 48 hours, beginning on Capitol Hill early Tuesday, represented an unofficial inauguration of the 45th president -- a whirlwind welcome to Trump's Washington, a chaotic and contentious place where graying norms seem destined to clash relentlessly with an idiosyncratic administration. By Thursday morning, after a Senate vote-a-rama effectively paved the way for GOP efforts to dismember Obamacare, new information had emerged and old suspicions were affirmed, as the final countdown to the historic transition neared its end. Here are seven lessons -- and the moments that defined them -- from the past two days: "I have great respect for the news, great respect for freedom of the press and all that," Trump said during his long-delayed press conference Wednesday. But the lovefest had its limits, as the President-elect ripped CNN and BuzzFeed over a pair of stories published the day before -- CNN's a carefully sourced report; BuzzFeed's a less scrupulous document dump -- and purposefully conflated the two in order to avoid answering serious questions about his and his staff and advisers' alleged ties to Russia. Trump passed over Acosta during the news conference and Spicer threatened to eject him if he spoke up again. When ABC's Cecilia Vega pressed Trump on the matter, the President-elect spent nearly 90 seconds filibustering before heading for the elevators, where Unlike Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions a day earlier, Tillerson, the Exxon Mobil chief with extensive business ties to Moscow, "Is Vladimir Putin a war criminal?" the Florida senator asked. Tillerson hedged, saying he "would not use that term" and required "much more information" before giving a clear answer. Rubio pressed on, running off a laundry list of Russian aggression, from its actions in Aleppo to the murder of dissidents and journalists, but Tillerson didn't budge. Further questions about human rights abuses in Saudi Arabia and the Philippines were met with similar demurrals. By late Wednesday, Amnesty International USA had weighed in with their growing concerns. "After a day of questioning, Tillerson's commitment to human rights in the US and abroad is in serious question," the group's executive director, Margaret Huang, said in an email. "He must use tomorrow's hearing to clarify today's troubling statements." During the tenures of Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch, the Justice Department has been proactive in applying oversight measures to local law enforcement outfits found to have committed civil rights violations. The department has used a tool called a consent decree -- a period of enforced reform, with terms agreed by municipal authorities and Justice Department officials as a means of avoiding federal court action. "I think there is concern that good police officers and good departments can be sued by the Department of Justice when you just have individuals within a department that have done wrong," Sessions said when asked during the first day of his hearing. "These lawsuits undermine the respect for police officers and create an impression that the entire department is not doing their work consistent with fidelity to law and fairness, and we need to be careful before we do that." With an attorney general -- and Sessions is all but guaranteed to be confirmed -- so openly critical of the process, it's hard to imagine the Trump Justice Department will be initiating the reviews that became a hallmark of its predecessor. Protesters from a variety of grassroots progressive groups and larger liberal organizations were often the harshest voices in the room during Sessions' hearings. They rose at seemingly regular intervals to rail against the Alabama senator, who was denied a federal judgeship in 1986 amid allegations he made racist comments to a colleague. More recently, Sessions has emerged as a vocal backer of voter ID laws. Activist Kai Newkirk, who was arrested during a sit-in at Sessions' office, told CNN Wednesday he was willing to be jailed because "Sessions' history and present positions make it undeniably clear that he cannot be entrusted to uphold equal justice, civil rights, or the right to vote." Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee panel were mostly restrained in their questioning, with Minnesota's Al Franken the rare Sessions colleague to confront him over his past record -- deliberately overstated, Franken suggested -- as a civil rights proponent. With their party set to turn over the White House, and already nearly powerless in Congress, Democrats sitting on Capitol Hill could soon take a backseat to progressives and allied groups planning to stand up to Trump with mass protests and direct actions. As their colleagues came under fire for offering what liberals saw as an overabundance of "Those who are committed to equal justice in our society wonder whether Sen. Sessions' call for 'law and order' will mean today what it meant in Alabama when I was coming up back then," Lewis said during his testimony. "The rule of law was used to violate the human and civil rights of the poor, the dispossessed, people of color." Booker, meanwhile, sought to channel the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., when he said, "The arc of the moral universe does not just naturally curve toward justice, we must bend it." "America needs an attorney general who is resolute and determined to bend the arc," Booker testified. "Sen. Sessions' record does not speak to that desire, intention or will." Booker's decision to so publicly oppose a Senate colleague -- Difficult conversations are obviously not new in this country and they escalated during the course of the Obama administration, when Americans were focused at various times on Ferguson, Baltimore, Black Lives Matter and the very visceral fight over voting rights and the Confederate flag. Trump and his cabinet will bring a very different perspective than Obama and his. Partisan fights over race seem destined to escalate over the coming four years. The director, however, was not in a forthcoming mood and refused to comment. Maine Sen. Angus King, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, couldn't help himself. "You didn't say one way or another whether even there was an investigation underway?" King asked again. "Correct," Comey said. "I don't, especially in a public forum, we never confirm or deny a pending investigation." "The irony of your making that statement here, I cannot avoid," King said, a clear reference to Comey's looser lips during the campaign, when he jolted the contest with a very late public revelation that his agents would renew their review of emails potentially tied to Hillary Clinton's private server. Clinton was cleared, again, days later, but many Democrats believe the brouhaha cost her precious votes in a race that was ultimately decided by the narrowest of margins in a handful of states. Like Trump, their grudge is likely to endure. "After my election," Obama told supporters in McCormick Place, "there was talk of a post-racial America. Such a vision, however well-intended, was never realistic. Race remains a potent and often divisive force in our society." Framing that divide as a "threat to our democracy," Obama pleaded with Americans to emerge from their digital bubbles and more openly engage with political opposites. "If you're tired of arguing with strangers on the Internet," he said to laughs, "try talking with one of them in real life." But his appeal to economic solidarity -- which sounded a lot more like Bernie Sanders than his would-be successor Hillary Clinton -- struck hardest. "If every economic issue is framed as a struggle between a hardworking white middle class and an undeserving minority, then workers of all shades are going to be left fighting for scraps while the wealthy withdraw further into their private enclaves," he said, while pointedly encouraging Democrats to engage "the middle-aged white guy." Whether that adds up to a winning strategy remains to be seen, but for a night at least, the departing Obama towered over the Democrats he leaves behind to take on Trump.

The move, which wasn't previously outlined and is likely one of the final foreign policy decisions of Obama's term, terminates a decades-long policy that many argued amounted to preferential treatment for a single group of migrants. "By taking this step, we are treating Cuban migrants the same way we treat migrants from other countries," Obama wrote in a statement Thursday. "The United States, a land of immigrants, has been enriched by the contributions of Cuban-Americans for more than a century," he continued. "Since I took office, we have put the Cuban-American community at the center of our policies. With this change we will continue to welcome Cubans as we welcome immigrants from other nations, consistent with our laws." The policy, in place for more than two decades, had applied solely to Cubans. Following a mass exodus of Cubans to the United States, former President Bill Clinton in the mid-1990s changed the "open door" policy on Cuban refugees -- first established by President Lyndon B. Johnson -- to the "wet, foot, dry foot" policy that repatriated Cubans intercepted at sea but allowed those who reach land to stay. The US said Cuba had agreed as part of the announcement to accept migrants who were turned away from the United States back into the country. Havana has long argued the policy encourages Cubans to make the dangerous crossing from Cuba to Florida. Immigrants from other nations have argued the policy amounts to preferential treatment for one group. The decision was likely Obama's last move in his historic dealings with Cuba. In 2014, he reopened ties to the island nation after a half-century of frozen diplomatic ties. "During my administration, we worked to improve the lives of the Cuban people -- inside of Cuba -- by providing them with greater access to resources, information and connectivity to the wider world," Obama said. "Sustaining that approach is the best way to ensure that Cubans can enjoy prosperity, pursue reforms and determine their own destiny." Critics of the change in relations with Cuba, though, charge that the Cuban government hasn't improved its treatment of dissidents and other anti-democratic actions, and now lack pressure from the United States to changes its ways. Soon after the announcement, former Florida Republican Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart tweeted, "Obama will continue to shower the enemies of freedom with gifts until 1/20/17." Democratic New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez, a Cuban-American, put out a blistering statement denouncing the move as one that "will only serve to tighten the noose the Castro regime continues to have around the neck of its own people." He faulted the Obama administration for not consulting Congress prior to the announcement, adding, "The Obama administration seeks to pursue engagement with the Castro regime at the cost of ignoring the present state of torture and oppression, and its systematic curtailment of freedom." But fellow Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont welcomed the move. "I think it's a good idea," said Leahy, long a proponent of thawing relations between the US and Cuba. "We were telling the rest of the world they were different, and I don't think that was the right thing to do." The Cuban government was informed of the decision to end the controversial policy towards Cuban refugees, according to a senior Cuban government official. The US government will now consider residency requests from these Cubans in the same way other migrants are processed when they arrive into the country. Officials said Thursday's decision does not affect Cubans already inside the United States, only future migrants who have not yet arrived. The Department of Homeland Security has also eliminated a policy for Cuban medical professionals known as the Cuban Medical Professional Parole Program, according to an agency statement. DHS is also eliminating an exemption that previously prevented the use of expedited removal proceedings for Cuban nationals apprehended at ports of entry or near the border. The existing Cuban Family Reunification Parole Program is not affected by this announcement and remains in effect. Explaining the timing of the announcement Tuesday, Obama administration officials said it took time to negotiate elements of the shift with the Cuban government. They said the unexpected nature of the move stemmed from a desire to prevent a surge of migrants hoping to get to the United States before the change. "We did not want to speculate publicly about the likelihood of this change for fear of inviting even greater migration flows," deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes said. The number of Cuban migrants entering the US had doubled from 2014 to 2015, when relations were reestablished. Following the thawing of relations between the Cold War enemies, Cubans, afraid the policy would soon end, began leaving the island in greater numbers. Many who leave use makeshift rafts to cross the Straits of Florida into the United States.

Rose followed up and asked if Al-Baghdadi's days were numbered, Carter replied, "Absolutely."

That includes whether intelligence indicates if he is in Syria or Iraq or to what extent he is hiding. One longstanding theory held by US officials is that Baghdadi has remained in Raqqa, Syria. On December 16, the US increased the reward on Baghdadi from $10 million to $25 million for information leading to his capture. According to Iraq's Shiite-led Popular Mobilization Units (PMU), Baghdadi is hiding in an area west of Mosul.

Chris Coons said Friday that it "seems very suspicious" that President-elect Donald Trump's pick for national security advisor spoke to Russia's ambassador to the United States on the same day the Obama administration announced sanctions against Russia for alleged hacking during the presidential election. An official with the Trump transition team said the ambassador texted retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn on December 28, the day before sanctions were announced, and the two spoke by phone the next day. The official insists sanctions were not discussed, and the phone call focused on how to connect Trump with Russian President Vladimir Putin after the inauguration. In an interview on CNN's "Outfront," Coons, a Democrat from Delaware who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told Erin Burnett the Trump team's defense "does strain credibility" and that "it seems very suspicious that three weeks in advance, he (Flynn) needed to have a call in order to schedule a call that wouldn't happen for weeks." Coons said once Trump takes office, however, Flynn is free to choose which foreign countries and ambassadors he makes contact with. Coons said Flynn's conversations are the latest in a series of developments that "raise real questions" about Trump's nomination of former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson to be the next secretary of state. The senator praised Tillerson, who received Russia's Order of Friendship in 2013, for providing "very forceful, very forthcoming" answers to questions he posed in a private meeting and this week's hearing about where he differs with Trump. But Coons pointed to other questions about human rights and sanctions "where Rex Tillerson didn't acquit himself very well, where he didn't give clear or strong answers." At this moment, Coons said he believes Tillerson's nomination "is in some doubt," but said he has not decided yet whether he will support or oppose Tillerson. The senator said he plans to go over the transcript of Tillerson's confirmation hearing and consult with Democratic and Republican colleagues before making up his mind.

Dave Reichert had sent a letter to the Architect of the Capitol with his concerns about the painting, which depicts police officers as pigs. House Speaker Paul Ryan also took a stand against the art, which hanged in a tunnel at the US Capitol, Friday, Reichert said Ryan's office informed him the painting will be taken down after the federal holiday. The painting won Democratic Rep. William Lacy Clay's congressional art competition in May and was created by 18-year-old David Pulphus. Clay, of Missouri, said congressional members have no role in judging the competition, and he called the saga of the painting a "manufactured controversy." Reichert, a Washington Republican, said the painting violated the rules on artwork at the Capitol. "The Congressional Art Competition is an opportunity to celebrate the creativity of students in every corner of our country -- and visitors from around the world see their talents on display when they walk through the halls of our Capitol," Reichert said in a statement. "However, with any competition there are rules, and these rules exist for a reason. This painting hung in clear defiance to those rules and was a slap in the face to the countless men and women who put their lives on the line everyday on behalf of our safety and freedom." Ryan told the congressman that the Architect of the Capitol made the determination, Reichert's office said. The rules of the art competition state: "Exhibits depicting subjects of contemporary political controversy or a sensationalistic or gruesome nature are not allowed," according to the statement from Reichert. Ryan said it isn't a question of First Amendment rights. "Of course, this young person has the right to do something like this wherever they want to," Ryan said. "But we do have rules that govern these paintings, so it's not as if you have a constitutional right to hang whatever you want in the House hallway in the Capitol gallery." The painting had been initially taken down by Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter of California last Friday. Tuesday, members of the Congressional Black Congress ceremoniously rehung the painting, only for it to be re-removed.

The Democratic National Committee will hold its first of four regional forums featuring the candidates to become party chair, ahead of an election in February. But before Democrats move on, they're going to revisit 2016. Bernie Sanders' supporters are still seething about the DNC's role in limiting the party's debate schedule and appearing to favor Hillary Clinton during the primaries. And the former secretary of state's loss to Donald Trump further angered progressives who saw Sanders successfully court the very working-class voters who abandoned Clinton, costing the party the White House. The race for DNC chair has turned into a Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is the more moderate, outside, alternative ala Martin O'Malley, and three other candidates are also seeking the job. Despite the lofty title, the function of the national party chair is fairly limited. Fundraising and helping state and local parties develop the tools they need to operate and target Democratic voters central to the job -- and coalition-building and television appearances are big parts of it. And the chair of the Democratic Party isn't necessarily the leader of the Democratic Party. The party's most important voices long-term are likely to be the candidates Democrats field in governor's races in Wisconsin, Ohio and Michigan -- where the party's loss of white, working-class voters has been most acute. The Democratic National Committee is also unlikely to be a core driver of the party's messaging in the era of Trump -- when figures including Sanders and Elizabeth Warren galvanize the party's liberal base in opposition to Trump. "Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have Expecting more from a party chair, some Democrats said, would be to ignore the reality that opposition to Trump is what gels Democrats' disparate factions -- and will continue to do so during his tenure in office. "In 2010, what was the message? Were Mitch McConnell and John Boehner the most compelling figures in America? No. People were galvanized by anger," said Neera Tanden, the president of the Democratic think tank Center for American Progress. "That's what's happening now." Increasingly, Democrats are acknowledging that the most daunting tasks the party faces aren't in messaging but technical -- starting with reversing Republicans' gains in redistricting and in curbing voting access. Eric Holder, the former attorney general, kicked off a new initiative called the National Democratic Redistricting Committee on Thursday. It is intended to help the undo the favorable districts Republicans drew after clobbering Democrats in state legislative and governor's races in 2010 -- the year of the last census. District lines won't be redrawn until 2020, but Holder argued Democrats need to begin readying their fundraising, court cases and more to fight what he called "the biggest rigged system in America." Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy, who is leading the redistricting group along with Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Ben Ray Lujan, D-New Mexico, acknowledged Democrats nationally have ignored the state-level map-making fights for too long. "We should have gone to court much more quickly in the states that we eventually went to court in," he said in an interview, pointing to recent court victories in Virginia and Florida as evidence Democrats can force GOP-held legislatures' hands. Malloy argued a focus on governors' races in the coming years is critical, too -- because those statewide races are more winnable than GOP-drawn state legislative districts, giving Democrats a voice or at least a veto in many states headed into 2020. He said the focus on redistricting is part of the party's broader need to turn its eyes from Washington to the states. "I want a less Washington-centric party, quite frankly. I want a party that represents the diversity of Democratic interests and is a 50-state plus territory party," Malloy said. "I think that is over-consideration of what's good for Washington has hurt the party, and listen -- I want to control the Senate someday and I want to control the House someday," he said. "But that doesn't mean we should be sacrificing governor's races to do it when the governors are the most important factor in any state to being a vibrant Democratic Party." The other technical challenge, Democrats said, is voting access -- a broad category that includes voter ID laws that many in the party believe unfairly punish older and urban voters, as well as early voting access and the ease of voter registration. The Center for American Progress urged a focus on those voting access issues in a "Path Forward" report, attempting to steer Democrats' focus toward that issue as well as combating corruption and opposing Trump when his actions favor the wealthy over the working class. Attempting to remain upbeat, many Democrats argued recriminations over 2016 and the doom-and-gloom talk of the party's empty bench is reminiscent of John Kerry's loss to George W. Bush in 2004 and ignores recent political history. "If in January 2005, you would have told me that in 2009, the next president of the United States is going to be a man named Barack Obama, who's African-American and from Illinois," Tanden said, "I would have been like, 'you're high.'" "If in January 2005, you would have told me that in 2009, the next president of the United States is going to be a man named Barack Obama, who's African-American and from Illinois," Tanden said, "I would have been like, 'you're high.'" ©President-elect Donald Trump's transition team is engaged in active discussions with the US Army Corps of Engineers and Interior Department to begin planning a wall along the Mexican border, including how specific environmental laws could get in the way, CNN has learned. A US official with knowledge of a visit last last month to the Interior Department -- which oversees most federal lands and major environmental laws -- said the transition team was particularly interested in finding out "how long it would take" to build the wall given potential legal obstacles. "It seems clear they were trying to size up the environmental laws that may be obstacles to building the wall," the source said. Another US official told CNN the Trump transition team has also reached out to the Army Corps of Engineers' Southwest Division, that has previously built border security fencing, to determine what previous fencing cost and how it was constructed. The team also asked Interior several questions, including how much wall would be needed, in an effort to determine a solid number of miles of wall necessary to secure the southern border. The moves by the transition team, including previously reported questions to the Department of Homeland Security, show how seriously Trump is taking his promise to build a massive physical barrier between the US and Mexico. The idea energized backers at this rallies but was dismissed by opponents as expensive and unfeasible. Trump was loud and clear in his first news conference since being elected that he wants to move quickly on the wall. "It's not a fence. It's a wall," Trump said Wednesday. "We'll start immediately after we get to office; I don't want to wait." Vice President-elect Mike Pence had started efforts to get clearances from Congress and agencies to begin construction of the wall, Trump said. This outreach provides a window into how the Trump team -- which did not respond to a request for comment on this story -- is thinking about making the wall a reality. The official told CNN it appeared transition officials were feeling out "what kind of regulatory barriers are in the way so they could possibly get rid of them." There are local, state and federal laws on the books that would protect endangered species and air and water quality. But one environmental law expert says what the Trump transition team could end up using language in the REAL ID Act that Congress passed in 2005. The law includes a provision that allows the secretary of Homeland Security the power to waive all local, state and federal laws that the secretary determines is an obstacle to building walls and roads along US borders. The Sierra Club said the law allows DHS to waive more than 30 federal laws "in their entirety." Some of those federal environmental laws include the National Environmental Policy Act, Endangered Species Act, Clean Water Act, National Historic Preservation Act, Migratory Bird Treaty Act, Clean Air Act and the Archaeological Resources Protection Act. In 2008 Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff invoked that power to waive environmental laws to construct barriers along portions of the southern border. Melinda Taylor, an environmental law professor with the University of Texas, said the George W. Bush-era law is a powerful tool. "The new administration has a wild card they can pull and it's in this law," Taylor said. "The language in this law allows them to waive all federal laws that would be an impediment to building any type of physical barrier along the border, including a wall." None of this addresses the projected multibillion-dollar cost of the wall. Congress would still have to approve funding to construct the wall, and Trump has promised he will get Mexico to eventually pay for the project. But removing some potential environmental legal fights could speed things up. A third US official told CNN the Department of Homeland Security has been preparing for a scenario where they are told a wall along the southern border must be built. "The moment Donald Trump won the election, DHS started discussions about how to achieve a wall if tasked to help make it happen. Those conversations included determining where to start erecting the wall first and identifying the priority areas along the border," the source told CNN. Taylor said if the new administration waives all federal laws that are intended to protect the environment and historic preservation "it will be particularly tragic." "If they really try to build a wall, without regard for environmental laws and without environmental impact statements, the effect of a border wall would be more catastrophic than a border fence," she said. A wall would prevent water from flowing across the Mexican border, and there is also wildlife that migrates across the border, including the endangered ocelot, also known as a dwarf leopard, located in south Texas and northern Mexico, she said. "US Fish and Wildlife has spent a lot of money to preserve this animal and there are only a couple dozen left," Taylor added. Many other endangered species live along the border in California and Arizona as well. There is also the issue of Native American territory and private land that straddles the border as well as the historic preservation of potential archeological artifacts in the area. Taylor is urging the new administration to do the impact studies so that "they have the data about the potential impact of a wall and find ways to minimize the impact."

Michael Flynn, President-elect Donald Trump's pick for national security advisor, has been in contact with Russia's ambassador to Washington, Trump's team told CNN Friday. Sean Spicer, Trump's spokesman, said Flynn and the Russian ambassador to Washington, Sergey Kislyak, aren't in frequent contact but they have been in touch recently on a number of issues. Some instances included when the two had a conversation in the wake of the shooting of the Russian ambassador to Turkey, in which Flynn expressed his condolences, according to a transition official. The two men also exchanged holiday pleasantries via text message on Christmas, according to multiple transition officials. The Russian ambassador texted Flynn on December 28 but the two did not connect by phone until December 29, according to a transition official. A centuries-old law, the Logan Act, forbids any US citizen acting without official US authority from influencing "disputes or controversies" involving the US and a foreign government. The December 29 phone call was on the same day that President Barack Obama ordered sanctions on Russia, as well as ordered 35 Russian diplomats and their families to leave the country -- but a transition official told CNN that Flynn and Kislyak did not discuss the Russian sanctions. The Washington Post Multiple transition officials, however, said that the call focused on the logistics of connecting Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin after the inauguration for a phone conversation. "The call centered around the logistics of setting up a call with the President of Russia and the President-elect after he was sworn in, and they exchanged the logistical information," Spicer said. "That was it. Plain and simple." One of the officials added that Kislyak, in a conversation on December 29, also extended an invitation for a representative from the US to attend the upcoming Syria peace talks in Kazakhstan. The same day as that conversation, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov made clear Trump would be welcome at the table for Syrian peace talks. "I would like to express the hope that as soon as the administration of Donald Trump takes office, they will also be able to join these efforts," Lavrov said during a meeting with Putin in Moscow. The Trump transition official said they are not aware of any additional conversations between Flynn and the Russian ambassador since December 29. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest was asked Friday whether it bothered the administration that Flynn was in contact with the Russian ambassador. "I've read some of these reports and I think, to answer your question as bluntly as I can, it depends on what he said," Earnest responded. "And I know that some members of the President-elect's transition team have tried to describe those conversations. Obviously, I have zero insight into what may have been communicated back and forth, so I'd refer you to General Flynn himself or spokespeople for the transition who may be able to provide additional insight into the nature of those conversations and why those conversations were initiated." Flynn's ties to Russia have been scrutinized since Trump tapped him to become his closest adviser on national security. On one occasion, Flynn was seated next to Putin at a Russian media gala in December 2015, and he previously had a paid speaking gig with Russia Today, the Kremlin's TV network, though it was before he took on a formal campaign role. On Friday, Trump again, using Twitter, denied claims that Russia had compromising information on him and continued to accuse the intelligence chiefs of leaking the allegations.

He told "If you get along and if Russia is really helping us, why would anybody have sanctions if somebody's doing some really great things?" he said in the interview. Trump's remarks to the Wall Street Journal come after Speaking to the Journal, Trump said he's prepared to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin after he takes office. "I understand that they would like to meet, and that's absolutely fine with me," he said. When asked about China -- specifically if he supported the US "One China" policy on Taiwan, which says the province is part of China -- Trump responded, "Everything is under negotiation, including One China." In early December, Trump took a call from Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen, Trump said during the election that when he took office, he would label China as a currency manipulator. However, he didn't go that far in his interview with the Journal. "I would talk to them first," he said, later adding: "Certainly, they are manipulators. But I'm not looking to do that."

The vote was The Senate passed the measure earlier this week. It allows Republicans on Capitol Hill to use a process known as "budget reconciliation" to roll back major parts of the health care law. Top Republican leaders are also saying they plan to move to replace Obamacare along the same track, but they are still struggling to come up with the details on how it will work. Only nine Republicans crossed the aisle to side with Democrats against the measure: Reps. Justin Amash, Charlie Dent, Brian Fitzpatrick, Walter Jones, John Katko, Raul Labrador, Tom MacArthur, Thomas Massie and Tom McClintock. No Democrats voted for the resolution. Some Republicans, like Pennsylvania moderate Dent, said they were concerned that the GOP does not have a clear plan to replace Obamacare yet. Dent cautioned that Friday's decision could further send insurance markets into a spiral. "If there's uncertainty and these markets are already collapsing without us doing anything, this type of action could accelerate the collapse. So we have to make sure we have clear idea how we're going to land this plane," Dent said after the vote. "Before we take this plane in the air, I want to know we're going to land it. Right now I'm not sure we can land it." "I just couldn't vote because I think we're going a little too fast," said MacArthur of New Jersey. "That said, I understand Leadership's goals and I agree with them. We have to fix what is clearly broken with Obamcare. We have to fix that. I have for years said we have to repeal and replace." Amash, the leader of a group of libertarian Republican members, explained afterward that he opposed the measure because of broader concerns about government spending. (Friday's vote also formally approved budget guidelines for the current fiscal year.) "Most massive budget in U.S. history passed 227-198. It adds more than $9 TRILLION to the debt over the next decade," Amash, a Michigan Republican tweeted. But the focus and the fight was clearly on Obamacare -- which is set to dominate much of the time in Washington in the coming months. "This is a signal that we are very serious about what we've campaigned on for years. It's the very beginning," said House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, who polled Republicans on their concerns before Friday's big vote. "We've said from the start, we've gotta have this first step to then go and not only repeal but replace Obamacare. I think this shows we have strong resolve to follow through on that process." House Speaker Paul Ryan said that Republicans were now sending in a "rescue mission" to fix the massive healthcare law. "I can't help but think back to when we were debating this law in 2010. As a member of the minority, I stood right here and pleaded with the majority not to do it. Don't take something as personal as health care and subject it to this big government experiment. Don't do something so arrogant and so contrary to our founding principles," Ryan said in a rare floor speech. "My colleagues, this experiment has failed. This law is collapsing as we speak. And we have to step in before things get even worse. This is nothing short of a rescue mission." Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi -- who led the passage of the law in 2009 and 2010 when Democrats controlled the House -- accused Republicans of attempting to "cut and run" on people with health insurance and argued that Republicans would end up cutting Medicare benefits as well. "The Republican replacement plan is cut and run: cut benefits, cut investments and hospitals that care for our people, cut jobs. It's with no positive upside to it," Pelosi said. 'We are not going to identify ourselves with cut and run, cutting benefits, cutting of those covered and cutting the savings that we have there." By using the budget process, Republicans are taking advantage of the same process which Democrats used seven years ago to pass the law -- using a special budgeting rule that allows them to skirt a filibuster in the Senate. But that strategy only works for fiscal measures in the healthcare law -- like tax credits -- and leaves untouched some of the more popular slices of the law, like allowing children to stay on their parents' plans until they are 26. The vote will clear the decks for Republicans to begin working on a repeal of the law -- but the larger debate has engulfed the Capitol over how and when Republicans would replace the law. The debate over replacement has exposed some rifts within the Republican Party, which now controls the White House and both chambers of Congress -- the same position Democrats were in seven years ago. Some conservative Republicans, including members of the small but influential House Freedom Caucus, balked at the measure -- citing concerns about the timeline to replace Obamacare, and the lack of spending cuts in the underlying budget being voted one. At the same time, more moderate members of the party are concerned about the party moving forward with repeal without more detailed replace plans. Millions of Americans could lose health insurance if Obamacare was rolled back before a replacement was in place. The budget concerns have prompted Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul to vote against his party and the bill in the Senate, though Republicans still had the votes needed to pass it. Leadership insists that the resolution is only a shell for the budget, and not the final numbers. But any replacement measure un-related to the budget will have to clear 60 votes in the Senate -- a prospect that requires Democratic support, as Republicans only have a 52-seat majority. Republicans also have several competing plans to replace Obamacare, and No. 2 Senate Republican John Cornyn has indicated that the party may opt to move smaller pieces of legislation as opposed to one overarching replacement. Ryan "We want to do this at the same time, and in some cases in the same bill," Ryan said. "So we want to advance repealing this law with its replacement at the same time." "We want to do this at the same time, and in some cases in the same bill," Ryan said.

The Trump proposal, which includes a childcare tax credit and six weeks of maternity leave protection, carries a hefty $300 billion price tag. Trump transition officials believe the best bet to get it passed is through broader tax reform efforts. The phone call with Ways & Means staffers is aimed at making clear that this is a top priority on the President-elect's agenda and to begin finding ways to pay for the proposal to make it budget neutral. Trump transition officials hope to pool money from other programs and through tax reform to pay for the childcare and maternity leave proposal, the transition source said. But most congressional Republicans have opposed similar proposals from Democrats on paid family leave, and are likely to be wary of the cost. Details on the GOP tax reform proposal are not expected to be decided until the spring.

And it's the last place the head of the nation's top law enforcement agency wants to be, especially with six years left in his 10-year term. The The decision revived Democrats' arguments that Comey helped swing the election in Donald Trump's favor at the same time as he once again finds himself playing a central role in the most sensitive political story of the moment: The question now is whether Comey can withstand this latest round of political fire. The investigation will focus on how the FBI handled the Clinton email server investigation, particularly the agency's public disclosures about the investigation in the middle of the presidential election. The review will examine whether Comey followed Justice Department and FBI policies when he took the unusual step of delivering a public statement explaining why his agency wouldn't pursue criminal charges against Clinton. It was in that public statement that Comey said Clinton was "extremely careless" in her handling of emails. The probe is also expected to focus on Comey's public letter to members of Congress less than two weeks before the election announcing that the FBI had discovered new emails potentially relevant to the investigation into Clinton's email server. Soon after, the FBI announced it wasn't changing its July recommendation that Clinton not face criminal charges -- but Democrats have argued the damage against Clinton was already done. Some are feeling vindicated -- but disappointed that it took so long for this kind of review to take place. Brian Fallon, a former Clinton campaign spokesman, described the mood among Clinton staffers as "appreciative" of the news. "A number of us that worked on the campaign were in touch yesterday in light of this news and all of us were appreciative of the fact that there's finally going to be an authoritative statement for the historical record about the inappropriateness of what happened here," Fallon said Friday on CNN's "New Day." Fallon called Comey's actions "significantly questionable" and said Comey's letter to members of Congress notifying them of newly discovered emails that might be relevant to the Clinton server investigation -- plus Wikileaks' publication of apparently hacked emails of John Podesta and other Democratic Party members -- "combined for a perfect storm of a bad swirl of information." Even Corey Lewandowski, Trump's former campaign manager, cited Comey's letter as a factor that helped the Republican nominee win, saying "with 11 days to go in this election cycle, something amazing happened" in a post-election speech. He hasn't indicated that he has any plans to do so. But the inspector general's review will certainly ensure that the question continues to be raised. Comey, for his part, welcomed the review and said "everyone will benefit from thoughtful evaluation and transparency regarding this matter." But it's not all that's amplifying the drumbeat demanding his resignation. Testifying before the Senate Intelligence Committee this week, Comey laid bare the inconsistencies of his responses to various investigations. Comey declined to confirm or debunk reports that the FBI has been probing potential contacts between the Trump campaign and the Russian government, saying "especially in a public forum we never confirm or deny a pending investigation." Sen. Angus King, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, seized on the fact the Comey was now mum when he acted very differently in the Clinton email server investigation. "The irony of your making that statement here, I cannot avoid," King said incredulously. Comey reiterated the investigation into Clinton's email server was closed when he spoke about it.. It prompted the Wall Street Journal's conservative editorial board to call for Comey's resignation, citing a "long history of apparently political decisions" that have hit both sides of the political aisle. "If the FBI director has demonstrated anything in the last year, it's that he has lost the trust of nearly everyone in Washington, along with every American who believes the FBI must maintain its reputation as a politically impartial federal agency," read the Journal's editorial. It wasn't Comey's decision alone to provide Trump with a two-page summary of an unverified report compiled by a former British intelligence official whose Russian sources claimed to have compromising personal and financial information about the incoming president. But Comey was tapped to brief Trump directly on the allegations after the top four intelligence chiefs briefed Trump on Russian hacking during the election last Friday, according to multiple US officials briefed on the matter. The same sources tell CNN Comey briefed Trump one-on-one about the sensitive and unsubstantiated allegations. The decision to brief Trump -- Mike Morell, former CIA acting director, said he was "a bit surprised that our intelligence community would take a private document and summarize it for the President and President-elect if they didn't know anything about the credibility of the information in it." Morell said the briefing appeared to be "unprecedented." Trump, for his part, has panned the information as "totally made-up facts by sleazebag political operatives." Trump, for his part, has panned the information as "totally made-up facts by sleazebag political operatives." ©Donald Trump's nominee for defense secretary cleared an important legal hurdle on Friday as the House voted largely along party lines to grant him a special exemption from a key law that had been standing in his way. The House voted 268-151 in favor of giving Ret. Gen. James Mattis the needed waiver. The Senate voted overwhelmingly in favor of doing so on Thursday, after Mattis' confirmation hearing. President Barack Obama is expected to sign the waiver soon, a move that helps clear the way for installing one of the top members of his successor's national security team. Senate Republicans are aiming to vote on Mattis' confirmation to lead the Pentagon on January 20, the day President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in as president. Law dictates that any military official must wait seven years from leaving the service before serving as defense secretary, a civilian position. Mattis retired in 2013, meaning he could not be secretary of defense unless Congress passed a special exception. The law is designed to underscore the importance of civilian control over the military, a principle lawmakers said they did not take waiving lightly. A waiver had only been granted only once before, to George Marshall under then-President Harry Truman. The vote in the House was more contentious than the one in the Senate. Democrats on the House Armed Services Committee objected to Mattis abruptly canceling testimony scheduled for Thursday and repeatedly voiced their concern about voting without talking to Mattis during debate in the committee about moving the waiver forward. In the Senate, Mattis faced a low-key confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, where many Democrats expressed hope that the former US Central Command chief and former NATO supreme allied commander could serve as a check on the President-elect in use of force and military decision-making. Mattis' confirmation next week is expected given Republicans' majority and the overwhelmingly bipartisan 81-17 Senate vote in favor of the waiver on Thursday.

Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, ranking Democratic member of the Oversight Committee, sent a letter to Chaffetz requesting that the panel hear from Shaub in public. "I believe it is imperative that Director Shaub be permitted to testify in public -- before the American people -- to avoid any perception that he is being unfairly targeted behind closed doors for expressing his views," Cummings wrote. Sen. Charles Schumer tweeted, House GOP attempts to take down yet another independent federal ethics org; intimidates OGE mid review of next admin." Speaking at the Brookings Institution in Washington, Shaub said Trump's plan to separate himself from his business interests doesn't follow the tradition of presidents from the past four decades. "This is not a blind trust," he said. "It's not even close." Shaub's office is not an enforcement agency, but it advises executive branch officials about how to avoid conflicts. It's the office combing through the financial holdings of Trump's Cabinet nominees to look for problems.

John Lewis says he doesn't see President-elect Donald Trump as a "legitimate" commander in chief following Russian meddling in the 2016 election. "I don't see this President-elect as a legitimate president," Lewis, a Georgia Democrat, told NBC News' Chuck Todd in a clip released Friday. "I think the Russians participated in helping this man get elected. And they helped destroy the candidacy of Hillary Clinton." Lewis -- an ally of Martin Luther King Jr. who was brutally beaten by police in Selma, Alabama, in 1965 while marching for civil rights -- also said he planned to skip Trump's inauguration next week, which he said would be the first ceremony he would not attend since coming to Washington. He was elected to Congress in 1986. "You cannot be at home with something that you feel that is wrong," Lewis said. It was an astonishing rebuke by a sitting member of Congress toward an incoming President. Trump, however, largely launched his political career by calling into question the legitimacy of President Barack Obama's presidency by repeatedly suggesting he wasn't born in the United States. Trump "Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results. All talk, talk, talk - no action or results. Sad," Trump tweeted Saturday, which happened to fall on the weekend of the King federal holiday. Clinton's former aides have been reluctant to use similar language, avoiding passing judgment on whether Trump was "legitimate."

"Canadians expect their government to have a constructive working relationship with the incoming American administration, and that's exactly what we're going to do," Trudeau said during a town hall in Belleville, Ontario, in response to a question about how a Trump presidency will impact Canada's relationship with the United States. But, he said, "there are things that we hold dear that the Americans haven't prioritized." "And I'm never going to shy away from standing up for what I believe in -- whether it's proclaiming loudly to the world that I am a feminist, whether it's understanding that immigration is a source of strength for us and Muslim Canadians are an essential part of the success of our country today and into the future," he said as the audience applauded. Trudeau noted the historically strong economic ties between the North American neighbors. "We're going to make sure that we are fighting for Canadian jobs, Canadian economic growth, for opportunities for Canadians as it regards both our relations with the United States and indeed with the world." Trudeau did, however, say he was open to discussing matters with the US.

Marco Rubio are setting the wrong tone by calling Russian President Vladimir Putin a "war criminal." In the interview with Breitbart News Radio, Rohrabacher added that there were many examples of US hypocrisy towards Russia on display at the hearing of Donald Trump's secretary of state nominee, Rex Tillerson. "We have these people claiming that Mr. Putin is war criminal, alright," Rohrabacher told host Raheem Kassam, who asked the congressman if he was referring to Rubio (the Florida senator had asked Tillerson if he believed Putin was a "war criminal"). "He's not the only one doing this," Rohrabacher answered. "But it seems to me like what we've got are warmongers claiming other people are war criminals. This is the wrong kind of tone. That type of rhetoric is leading us to a point where we will be in conflict and the Russians will think that we are out to get them." The host Kassam then said he was very surprised Tillerson did not challenge "untrue" or hypocritical claims made about Russia during his hearing, like the claim that people who Putin doesn't like disappear in Russia. "Correct if I'm wrong, people have disappeared in this country under similar auspices with other politicians in the fray, have they not congressman?" asked Kassam. Rohrabacher did not challenge Kassam's claim, saying there are "many examples" of U.S. hypocrisy towards Russia. "Well, you can cite so many examples of this," he said. "Look this idea that, McCain I believe said, it's an act of war that they hacked into our system. We hacked into their system all the time. Not just their system, we're hacking into the systems, we're recording telephone conversations of foreign leaders. And we're doing that all the time."

Not just their system, we're hacking into the systems, we're recording telephone conversations of foreign leaders. And we're doing that all the time." ©Forty-year-old Robert Evans said he fell into the wrong crowd as a 17-year-old teen. "I think when I was young, I made a couple bad decisions. I started hanging out with older people. My dad struggled with a disability and I didn't have a father figure in my house." Those bad decisions led to a distribution of a controlled substance charge. "The juvenile justice system failed me," Evans said. Years later, he was charged again with three counts of marijuana possession and conspiracy to sell cocaine, and it was three strikes, you're out for the Alabama native: a judge sentenced him to life in prison in 2009 factoring in his previous drug charges. "I felt my sentence was unjust" Evans said, but he still held out hope. "I didn't know how it was going to come. I knew I was going to get a blessing." That blessing came last year when he became eligible to put in a petition to President Barack Obama for his sentence to be commuted. "I didn't have no hope at all to now having all the hope in the world," Evans said. But that hope is now beginning to dwindle for Evans. He is currently one of more than 13,000 inmates anxiously waiting for their requests to be granted before Obama leaves office next week, according to the Department of Justice. "Every time the list comes, I've been hoping and praying I'm on it," Evans said. Sentence reform advocates feel a sense of urgency because they doubt the Trump administration will continue Obama's initiative to provide relief to nonviolent drug offenders, some of whom are serving four or more times the sentence they would receive today, according to administration officials. "(Trump) is a law-and-order president and many of the people seeking clemency were incarcerated under law-and-order presidents," said Cynthia Roseberry of the Clemency Project. "I'd hope he would be able to continue (the initiative), but based on statements he has made, I'm not positive that he will." Donald Trump's nominee for attorney general, Sen. Jeff Sessions, has been a supporter of eliminating discrepancies between crack and cocaine offenders. But he also has criticized Obama's clemency initiative in the past, saying Obama "is playing a dangerous game to advance his political ideology," adding, "Unfortunately, history and common sense tell us that rushing to release federal prisoners will have long-lasting, harmful consequences, particularly for our nation's most vulnerable communities." During Sessions' confirmation hearing, Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin questioned him on why he doesn't support retroactively granting reduced sentences to inmates sentenced under mandatory minimums. "If you refuse to even acknowledge the fundamental injustice of many of our sentencing laws, why should you be entrusted with the most important criminal prosecution in America?" Durbin asked. Sessions claimed that comment was unfair. "I stepped out against my own Republican administration and said openly on the floor of the Senate that I believe these crack cocaine laws were too harsh, particularly disadvantageous to the African-American community," Sessions replied. The White House said it has granted more clemency petitions than the past 11 presidents combined, with more than 1,000 petitions granted last year alone. "The President looks at each one on an individual basis and then decides. I think we will keep going until the end and we'll continue to review," White House chief counsel Neil Eggleston recently told reporters. With one week left, Evans hopes his clean record while behind bars and self-improvement programs he has taken will convince Obama to grant his commutation. "I sowed good seeds my whole time of incarceration," Evans said. "The first thing I did was I got my relationship with God right. The second thing I did was get my GED." Evans -- who is a father of two biological children and two stepchildren -- said if he's released from his life sentence he will work on being a good father and a motivational speaker for young kids who may fall into the same trap he did as a teenager. "My plan is I just want to inspire people to do the right thing. I don't wish this on nobody," he said. "This is not a place I would want to spend the rest of my life. It's easy to get into but hard to get out." If his petition goes unanswered or is denied, Evans admitted he's most worried about his kids. "I've never told them I have a life sentence," he said, adding that he's particularly concerned about his 16-year-old son, RJ. "Me and my son are best friends. I couldn't dare tell him. I don't know what he might do." "Me and my son are best friends. I couldn't dare tell him.

The event, two days before his term ends and President-elect Donald Trump is sworn into office, will likely be the final time Americans will hear from Obama as a sitting commander in chief. It follows a tradition from past presidents of holding a concluding news conference. President George W. Bush took his final round of questions from reporters on January 12, 2009, eight days before Obama was sworn in. Back then, questions ranged from specific queries about tensions in the Middle East and his response to the financial crisis, to broader requests for Bush to reflect upon his presidency and a path forward for the GOP. Obama, too, is likely to face specific probes into the latest reporting about Russia's influence in the US election as well as larger issues of his legacy. After a quiet day Thursday, Obama wakes up Friday for the final time at the White House. He and First Lady Michelle Obama will welcome Trump and his wife Melania for tea and a small reception before traveling together by motorcade to the US Capitol. After Trump's swearing-in, the Obamas will attend Trump's inauguration address and will depart the US Capitol by helicopter for Joint Base Andrews. At Andrews, the former President will deliver remarks to a group of staff from across the administration to bid farewell. He and the first lady -- who have both said they're looking forward to a long vacation in a warm climate -- will depart Andrews on their last flight aboard the presidential aircraft.

"One thing I've said to him directly, and I would advise my Republican friends in Congress and supporters around the country, is just make sure that as we go forward certain norms, certain institutional traditions, don't get eroded, because there's a reason they're in place," Obama told CBS News' Steve Kroft in a taped interview for "60 Minutes." In a transition period that found the President-elect often commenting on presidential matters, Obama admitted it's been an "unusual" time. "I suspect the President-elect would agree with that," Obama said. "Look, he's an unconventional candidate." Obama noted that Trump "ran sort of an improvisational campaign" but cautioned him against running an "improvisational presidency," saying it will be a test to see if Trump can build an organization and execute the vision he laid out during the campaign. "I think everybody has to acknowledge, don't underestimate the guy, because he, he's going to be 45th president of the United States in about in about two weeks," Obama said of his successor. The outgoing President said partisanship that became even more evident during the 2016 campaign was something that surprised him during his time in office. "I will confess that -- I didn't fully appreciate the ways in which individual senators or members of Congress now are pushed to the extremes by their voter bases," Obama said. "I did not expect, particularly in the midst of crisis, just how severe that partisanship would be." One thing Obama said he will miss about the job is living in the White House and working with his staff. But, he said living within the hallowed halls is not exactly like people typically imagine. "You know, it's not free," Obama said of the presidential lifestyle. "I've got a grocery bill at the end of every month. Our toothpaste, our orange juice, that all gets paid. But it is true that I don't carry my wallet that often. So I'm going to have some catching up to do in terms of how day-to-day things operate." Obama told Kroft that he is looking forward to his next life phase and the tasks he aims to accomplish, such as writing a book and working on a foundation. The Obama family will stay in Washington and aren't moving far from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, to a But first, before settling into his new lifestyle, Obama says he's going on a vacation.

During the discussion, Conway disputed the accuracy of CNN's report that the heads of four intelligence agencies presented Trump with claims of Russian efforts to compromise him. "What's inaccurate about what CNN reported?" Cooper asked. "Oh my goodness, the whole headline," she replied. "Go read the entire story. Four bylines and a story that's just not true that the President-elect was presented with this information that it was appended in a two-page document to the briefing. NBC has said it was not. Other people have said it was not." Let's take a look at that. NBC merely cited an unnamed source who said that these unverified reports of Russia's efforts were not verbally communicated to Trump during the meeting. The NBC report clearly stated "a summary of the unverified reports was prepared as background material for the briefing, but not discussed at the meeting." In addition, James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, confirmed the material was provided to Trump when he said in a statement Wednesday, "part of our obligation is to ensure that policymakers are provided with the fullest possible picture of any matters that might affect national security." This one is a hardy perennial for Trump. He has referenced it several times. He cited it once again at his press conference, casting the job market as weaker than it truly is. "96 million really wanting a job and they can't get. You know that story. The real number. That's the real number," he said. Here's the real deal on that stat: Some 93.8 million people are not in the labor force, but the vast majority of them don't want a job, according to the most recent quarterly data from the Atlanta Federal Reserve. Some 44 million are retired, 15.3 million are disabled, 13.3 million are taking care of a family member and another 13.2 million are in college or job training. They are listed as not wanting a job. Some economists argue that the official unemployment figure -- 7.5 million in December -- understates the true state of the job market because it only counts people who are out of a job and have looked for work in the past four weeks. A wider measure of unemployment includes people who've left the labor force but want a job, and part-timers who want full-time positions. Altogether, these three types of job-seekers total about 16 million, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. (This item was originally posted by Patrick Gillespie and Tami Luhby.) During his press conference, Trump declared emphatically, "I have no deals in Russia. I have no deals that could happen in Russia because we've stayed away. ... We could make deals in Russia very easily if we wanted to. I just don't want to because I think that would be a conflict." Trump clearly has attempted to cut deals there in the past. As recently as 2013, the President-elect was negotiating a deal with Aras Agalarov, a Russian billionaire, to build a Trump Tower in Moscow, according to a Trump also has been trying unsuccessfully to build a Trump tower in Moscow for three decades. In 1987, he visited the Soviet Union with his first wife, Ivana, and announced plans to develop a luxury hotel there. Nine years later, he filed paperwork to trademark the name Trump Tower in Russia and subsequently registered other business names like Trump International Hotel and Tower, and Trump Home, according to a "Russia is one of the hottest places in the world for investment," Trump said during a 2007 court deposition. "We will be in Moscow at some point." Trump journeyed to Moscow in 2013 for the Miss Universe Pageant, schmoozed with a clutch of oligarchs at a nightspot and ultimately collected $14 million from Russians who invested in the beauty contest, according to the Washington Post. Trump's son, Donald Jr., made a half dozen business trips to Russia in 2007 and 2008 on behalf of the Trump Organization, according to the travel industry publication eTurboNews. "In terms of high-end product influx into the US, Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets; say in Dubai, and certainly with our project in SoHo and anywhere in New York," Trump Jr. said in the Indeed. Trump earned nearly $100 million when he sold a Florida mansion to a Russian oligarch named Dmitry Rybolovlev in 2008. During a press conference in July, Trump said that the sale of the mansion was his one and only link to Russia. It is true that there are no Trump-branded properties under construction in Moscow or elsewhere in the country but there is no way to verify the President-elect's claim that he is completely clear of business links to Russia without seeing his tax returns.

"This is the most complicated threat environment the United States has faced in recent memory," Pompeo told the Senate Intelligence Committee. That may be true, but what was the first piece of evidence Pompeo cited as proof of ISIS's reach? "ISIS remains a resilient movement that still controls major urban centers in the Middle East," Pompeo said. No doubt ISIS is resilient. But the only major urban center it controls today is Raqqa a modest-sized city in Eastern Syria, hardly a major center like Damascus, Cairo, Baghdad, or even Aleppo, Syria's second-largest city. ISIS is currently fighting against America-backed Iraqi and Kurdish forces to maintain its hold on Mosul, Iraq's second largest city. It's hard to say that it's in "control" there. To say that ISIS "controls major urban centers" is, at best, MISLEADING. At his confirmation hearing, Rex Tillerson, the nominee for Secretary of State, startled senators by stating flatly that he never worked against economic sanctions against Russia and Iran when he was CEO of Exxon-Mobil. "I have never lobbied against sanctions, personally," and "To my knowledge, Exxon never lobbied directly against sanctions, not to my knowledge," Tillerson said. There may be a kind of rhetorical tap-dancing going on here. After the Obama administration slapped economic sanctions against Russia in 2014, Tillerson, whose company could have lost out in billions of dollars in Russian oil deals, told Exxon-Mobil shareholders, "We do not support sanctions, generally, because we do not find them to be effective. Documents also show that Exxon-Mobil did lobby Congress about the sanctions, although Tillerson says the company was just making sure lawmakers were aware of the impact sanctions would have, not necessarily that Congress should halt them. ©The Senate Intelligence Committee's review of Russian meddling in the 2016 election will include a look at any intelligence "regarding links between Russia and individuals associated with political campaigns." Sen. Richard Burr, R-North Carolina, the committee's chairman, and Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia, the committee's vice chairman, said in a joint statement that the investigation into alleged Russian interference in the election also will focus on Russian cyberactivity and "active measures" against the US. It was known that intelligence panels in both chambers of Congress were tapped by Republican leaders to probe the hacking, but Friday's announcement makes clear the scope and details about the review. It is also notable that the announcement was joined by Warner, as Democrats have clamored for a bipartisan look into what role, if any, Russia may have played in the election. The statement said the committee will produce both a classified and unclassified report on its findings. Burr and Warner said the committee will hold hearings examining Russian intelligence activity and interview senior officials within both President Barack Obama and President-elect Donald Trump's administrations about the matter, and will issue subpoenas if necessary. "We believe that it is critical to have a full understanding of the scope of Russian intelligence activities impacting the United States," they said. The statement cited an announcement in early October by the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence that publicly raised the specter of Russia interfering in the election. On January 6, the intelligence community issued an unclassified report detailing information that generally concluded Russia attempted to interfere with the outcome of the election. Both Obama and Trump have publicly stated that they believe Russia was involved in the hacking, though Trump has repeatedly expressed skepticism at the intelligence community's findings, particularly its conclusion that Russia interfered to boost his chances of victory. Also on Friday, US officials told CNN that FBI Director James Comey explained in a Senate classified briefing Thursday why his bureau looked again into emails connected to the Hillary Clinton email server investigation in October. Comey told them for the first time that investigators found new classified emails -- which were on a computer owned by Anthony Weiner -- though none were marked classified, the officials said. Many were ones they had seen before, but some were new, and the FBI didn't know what they were dealing with. It appears Comey didn't provide as much information in a House briefing on Friday.

Members of the bipartisan "Problem Solvers Caucus" are urging Trump to prioritize "rebuilding America's infrastructure and reforming our tax code" and arguing that the "logic of combining (the two issues) into one package is compelling." Their On Thursday, Trump transition officials According to new data released Friday, On Thursday, Obama ©President-elect As Trump's prospective defense secretary, secretary of state and CIA director have been quizzed at confirmation hearings this week, important differences have emerged between how they see Russia and the views of the President-elect. House Speaker Paul Ryan, whose support in Congress will be vital to Trump as he seeks to push through major policy changes, also seems to be on a different page to Trump when it comes to America's traditional foe and its leader, President Vladimir Putin. Trump, in a tweet Friday, dismissed these apparent differences, saying he wanted his Cabinet nominees "to be themselves and express their own thoughts, not mine!" But where are the divisions most evident? "The fact that a foreign government tried to meddle in another government's election is wrong," Ryan told He called Russia a "global menace led by a man who is menacing." "Vladimir Putin does not share our interests," Ryan said. "He frustrates our interests. He violates his neighbors. ... He's not democratic. I really think a lot of the things that he is doing is to try to delegitimize the other democracies so that his illegitimate democracy doesn't look as illegitimate by comparison." Pompeo told the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that he embraced a comprehensive report of the intelligence community on the Russian breaches compiled earlier this month. "With respect to this report in particular, it's pretty clear about what took place here, about Russian involvement in efforts to hack information and to have an impact on American democracy," he said in response to questioning. "This was an aggressive action taken by senior leadership inside of Russia." He added that Russia would view the debate it has sparked in the US as something that would be "to their benefit." But he defended the intelligence community, saying of Trump: "I think he's going to learn that there are a lot of good men and women in the intelligence community who risk their lives to keep us safe." In a nod to Trump's complaints that some news organizations published the uncorroborated details, Ryan said: "I completely understand why he's frustrated that eight, nine days before his inauguration, this junk gets thrown out there." CNN has not published or aired any of the uncorroborated details from the memo. "NATO, from my perspective ... is the most successful military alliance certainly in modern world history, probably ever," Mattis said. "I have had discussions with him on this issue. He has shown himself open, even to the point of asking more questions and going deeper into the issue about why I feel so strongly." Mattis identified Russian aggression as one of the biggest security issues since WWII and said that would limit opportunities for cooperation with Moscow. "I think right now the most important thing is that we recognize the reality of what we deal with (in) Mr. Putin," Mattis said. "We recognize that he is trying to break the North Atlantic alliance, and that we take the steps, the integrated steps, diplomatic, economic, military and the alliance steps, working with our allies to defend ourselves where we must," he said. Tillerson blasted Russia's annexation of Crimea as an "illegal action" -- something Trump hasn't done -- and said he even would have sent Ukraine defensive weapons to use against Russia. But the nominee for secretary of state admitted that he'd only spoken to the President-elect about world affairs in general terms, and He added: "I'm all for engagement, but we also have to recognize reality and what Russia is up to.

"Clearly there are those who are creating hysteria, who are trying to support this witch hunt, and President-elect Trump himself described it like this." He "President Putin with his actions and his statements has clearly and undoubtedly showed his readiness to respect our partners, but this respect can only be mutual, it cannot be unilateral," he said. "That's why, of course, there should be more mutual respect in Russia-US ties, from our viewpoint, much more." Peskov also responded to Tillerson's statement on Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. "This is his position, we take it into consideration," Peskov said. "Of course, Russia will patiently keep explaining the matter (to him). Of course, we don't agree with (Tillerson's) wording and will be reasonably explaining our position (to him)." "This is his position, we take it into consideration," Peskov said. "Of course, Russia will patiently keep explaining the matter (to him).

And now the plum job -- that of solicitor general -- is up for grabs. So far, two names have emerged as strong potentials, but Donald Trump has yet to make the official pick. The two possible nominees reflect the opposite ends of a spectrum. The first, Charles J. Cooper, is a fixture of the Washington legal scene. The second, George Conway, would be an outside-of-the-box choice. Others are jockeying for the job and the situation is fluid, according to sources close to the transition. Anticipation -- in the corridors of elite law firms -- is mounting. The solicitor general is the person who argues on behalf of the government in the Supreme Court of the United States. That means the "S.G." stands in the ornate chamber, faces nine of the top legal minds in the country, and gets constantly interrupted with a deluge of questions from a very hot bench. Past solicitors general relish the experience. In fact, the legendary Thurgood Marshall, who changed the law as an NAACP-LDF attorney and later served on the Supreme Court, once said that his time as solicitor general from 1965-1967 was "the best job I've ever had, bar none." Marshall made the revelation to Lincoln Caplan who published a book in 1987 called "The Tenth Justice: The Solicitor General and the Rule of Law." Caplan said the job attracts those "endowed with a particular kind of logical mind, a capacious memory, but also a passion for the stuff of Supreme Court practice which is opinions and more opinions." While the solicitor general reports to the attorney general, he or she has responsibilities with other branches of government as well. That brings with it something rare in a government job: a large degree of independence. But the "inestimable privilege" of representing the government is only the "tip of the iceberg" said Paul D. Clement who served as solicitor general during the George W. Bush administration. "What really makes the solicitor general's job unique -- and makes it such an incomparable experience -- is the behind-the-scenes role of determining whether the United States will appealxe2x80x8e in thousands of cases each year and shaping the positions taken in those cases," he said. "The solicitor general probably makes more strategic calls about whether and how to appeal in a year than any other lawyer makes in a life time," he said. Sources say that Trump is considering Conway, a corporate attorney out of New York who is married to Kellyanne Conway a senior adviser to the President-elect. In many ways, picking Conway -- a partner of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz -- would be a vintage move for Trump because Conway is an outside-the-Beltway choice. Although Conway has only argued one case before the court, it was a big win. He's got all of the qualifications for the job. The fact that he only argued once gives him more experience than Elena Kagan who served as solicitor general from 2009 to 2010. She had never argued before the justices. Another person on Trump's list is Cooper. Unlike Conway, Cooper is often at the Supreme Court. He hails from Alabama, clerked for Chief Justice William Rehnquist, and has argued several cases before the Supreme Court. It was Cooper who stepped in to defend California's Proposition 8, a referendum that banned gay marriage. Most recently he worked behind the scenes to help prepare Sen. Jeff Sessions for his confirmation hearing for attorney general. Why would an established lawyer give up a law practice to go back into government? Because the role is considered a dream job. Caplan says the job means a lawyer gets to "practice at the apex of the American constitutional system" and run a staff of about 20 exceedingly smart lawyers. "They follow the court more closely than anyone in the country including the best constitutional scholars," Caplan said, adding they are "people who love the law in a particular way." Seth Waxman, who served from 1997 to 2001 put it this way: "In a country of 280 million souls, how does one ascertain what the interests of the United States are in litigation?" he queried at a 2002 conference hosted by Brigham Young University. "That is the solicitor general's most challenging and exciting mission." It was only in 1870 that a law was passed to establish the office and today there are more than 20 lawyers in the office. To some, it is a step that leads to the Supreme Court -- indeed three current justices served in the office. At his confirmation hearing Chief Justice John Roberts reflected on his years serving in the office, "I always found it very moving," he told the senators, "to stand before the justices and say, 'I speak for my country.'" At his confirmation hearing Chief Justice John Roberts reflected on his years serving in the office, "I always found it very moving," he told the senators, "to stand before the justices and say, 'I speak for my country.'" ©President-elect Donald Trump is looking for a surefire conservative for the Supreme Court, and Senate Democrats are vowing to fight his choice. But for all the escalating rancor, this round to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia could be the prelude to a more consequential battle. The possibility of a second Supreme Court vacancy in the near future is subtly affecting the strategy of the Republican Trump team in the final stages of selecting a candidate and of Democratic opponents girding for what could be years of political turmoil surrounding the composition of America's highest court. Scalia, who died last February, was a rigid conservative on social issues such as abortion rights, affirmative action and gay marriage. Trump's replacement would likely be a wash. But a Trump successor to either of the two eldest justices -- liberal Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who will turn 84 in March, or centrist-conservative Anthony Kennedy, turning 81 in July -- could truly transform the law in America. Consider the stakes if Justice Kennedy, for example, were to step down in the near future: He was the decisive, fifth vote to throw out tough abortion regulations in Texas last year. Without him, restrictions on when a woman may end a pregnancy are more apt to be upheld. Kennedy provided the key vote to affirm a University of Texas racial affirmative action policy in 2016. Without him, admissions practices boosting the chances of African American and Latino applicants to ensure campus diversity could be on shaky legal ground. Such policies have been upheld since 1978. In one of his most defining moves, Kennedy in 2015 cast the crucial fifth vote and wrote the opinion declaring a right to marriage for gay men and lesbians. Since a 1996 case, Kennedy has taken the lead against discrimination based on sexual orientation. Some former law clerks and others close to the justice say Kennedy, a Republican appointee now in his 30th year on the bench, has been privately considering retirement. He did not respond to requests to comment on any retirement plans. For her part, eldest Justice Ginsburg, a 1993 appointee of Democratic President Bill Clinton, has said she would stay on the bench as long as she is healthy. She spoke out against the Trump presidency last summer and is likely loath to give him the opportunity to appoint her successor. The next oldest justices are Stephen Breyer, a 1994 Clinton appointee who will turn 79 this year, and Clarence Thomas, a 1991 appointee of Republican President George H.W. Bush, who will turn 69. The current fight began last February when Scalia, 79, was found dead in his bed at a remote Texas hunting resort. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, immediately vowed to block any nominee of President Barack Obama, despite nearly a year left in his term. In March, Obama selected veteran appeals court judge Merrick Garland, and Senate Republicans stuck to the McConnell pledge, refusing even to hold hearings on Garland. That unprecedented stall has ratcheted up the partisan acrimony awaiting this first Trump nomination. Sen. Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat now chief deputy whip, is among those who have deemed the seat "stolen" by Republicans. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, has warned of Trump nominees, "If they're out of the mainstream we'll oppose them tooth and nail." President-elect Trump said on Wednesday that he intends to announce his nomination about two weeks after his January 20 inauguration. Trump advisers say they have pared his earlier list of 21 possible candidates down to six long-serving federal appeals court judges, including Steven Colloton of Iowa, Neil Gorsuch of Colorado, Thomas Hardiman of Pennsylvania, Raymond Kethledge of Michigan, William Pryor of Alabama and Diane Sykes of Wisconsin. But Trump aides say the selection process remains fluid and others candidates, including those on state supreme courts such as Michigan justice Joan Larsen, are still under consideration. The possibility of a second opening gives Trump a chance to placate conservative insiders jockeying for their favorite candidates, including GOP senators rooting for home-state jurists. Candidates edged out on this round may be on deck for the next. Trump is also using the possibility of a second opening to answer advisors, particularly from prior Republican administrations, who have pressed him to broaden his list of candidates to prominent conservative intellectuals. Among those left out were US Appeals Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh and former US Solicitor General Paul Clement, Washington insiders who would likely have made the shortlists of a more traditional Republican president. Yet, as much as the prospect of a second seat may offer a president more options, the potential for an ideological mismatch and a bruising confirmation fight cannot be dismissed. The possibility recalls the ordeal that led to the appointment of Anthony Kennedy three decades ago. When centrist Justice Lewis Powell announced his retirement in June 1987, President Ronald Reagan nominated hardline conservative Judge Robert Bork of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Then Sen. Ted Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat, immediately declared that his appointment would mean America's return to back-alley abortions and segregated lunch counters. The Senate rejected Bork's nomination by a vote of 58-42. President Reagan eventually turned to then-US Appeals Court Judge Kennedy of California. He was approved on a vote of 97-0 in February 1988. Democrats controlled the Senate back then. Republicans dominate now (52 seats, to 46 Democrats and 2 independents), which necessarily constrains Democratic chances for defeating Trump nominees. The Senate filibuster -- which requires 60 votes to break -- remains in effect for Supreme Court nominations, but GOP leaders could always decide to invoke the "nuclear option" to break that rule should Democrats not accede to an up-or-down vote on Trump's pick. Further, Democrats and their liberal allies now researching the backgrounds of Supreme Court candidates know that a succession of controversial appointments naturally tests the opposition's energy and resources. In 1986, for example, Democrats poured their opposition efforts into Reagan's elevation of then-Associate Justice William Rehnquist to be chief justice and gave Scalia, chosen to succeed him as an associate justice, limited scrutiny. Rehnquist ended up approved on a vote of 65-33; Scalia was approved 98-0. This time around liberal advocates are hoping that a Democratic show of force on the first nomination serves as a warning to Trump not to put up an uncompromising conservative for a more consequential opening.

The commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. Robert Neller, said Thursday that the troops have "no delusions about the difficulty and the challenges they're going to face." The Marines will be tasked with training and advising Afghan soldiers and police in the volatile opium-rich province. Afghan security forces there have been locked in constant clashes with Taliban insurgents, who have managed to reestablish a significant presence. Helmand sits in the country's southwest. While geographically large, it is very rural and contains only about 3% of the Afghan population. "The enemy has fought hard for Helmand," Gen. John Nicholson, the commander of US forces in Afghanistan, told reporters at the Pentagon last month. Nicholson said the Taliban "receive much of their funding from the narcotics trafficking that occurs out of Helmand," adding that "there's a nexus here between the insurgency and criminal networks that's occurring in Helmand that makes Helmand such a difficult fight." "This is a mission we've always been ready for," Lt. Gen. William Beydler, who oversees Marines in the region, told reporters last week. The contingent of Marines will replace US Army advisers currently carrying out the mission, forming "Task Force Southwest," to be commanded by Brig. Gen. Roger Turner Jr. "They continue to need international support," Turner said of the Afghan troops, noting that US personnel would be focusing on intelligence and logistics advice. Some of the troops will be operating in the vicinity of Camp Leatherneck, the one-time home of thousands of Marines in Afghanistan. "The Marine Corps has a deep operational history in Afghanistan, particularly Helmand Province," Turner said, with Beydler noting that Marines first deployed to the province in 2001 and later fought battles against insurgents in Sangin and Marjah, where Marines took some of their heaviest casualties. But the two officers were quick to downplay any symbolism in returning to a region that the Marines left after the end of formal combat operations in 2014. "I wouldn't read into this from a symbolic standpoint," Beydler said. "It just so happened that it turned up now and we're ready and we're going." Neller struck a similar tone, saying, "The simple reason why we're going back is because someone asked us if we could do this and I said, 'yes.' " Turner noted that there would be some advantages to going back, particularly when it came to rekindling relationships with America's partners in the Afghan army. "These are folks who we fought alongside and who we fought with and we bled with, and we think there'll be a real synergy in reestablishing relationships," Turner said. "We have a lot of blood, sweat and tears invested in Helmand, and so I think a lot of the Marines are really excited about this opportunity to go back and work again with our Afghan partners," Turner added.

Trump harshly responded to Lewis, tweeting Saturday that he is "all talk" and "no action" after the Georgia Democrat told NBC's Chuck Todd that Trump is not a "legitimate" president. During an interview on CNN's "Newsroom" with Poppy Harlow on Saturday, conservative radio host Ben Ferguson criticized Lewis for his comments and said he couldn't believe a congressman of Lewis' stature could question the President-elect's legitimacy. "It is unprecedented," Ferguson said. "I cannot imagine the fallout, the backfire that you would have if a Republican would have ever implied that about Barack Obama or Bill Clinton or JFK, or anyone else for that matter." Harlow and fellow guest Symone Sanders, the former press secretary for Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign, then began to interrupt Ferguson, reminding him there is a precedent, and it's recent. "Ben, that's exactly what many Republicans did," Harlow said, "including the President-elect for years questioning the legitimacy of the first black president." Trump launched his political career largely by suggesting President Barack Obama wasn't born in the United States and repeatedly calling for him to release his birth certificate.

No senators have yet said they are boycotting, though Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer Some members have said they will be protesting in Washington and in their districts instead. Responding to a question from CNN's Michelle Kosinski, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Tuesday that he believed the boycotts were "a reflection of the division in the country right now" and said members of Congress are "freer to express their opinion" than administration officials. Asked if members of the Obama administration would boycott the inauguration if they could, Earnest said he "wouldn't speculate on what people around here would say." Here's a list of Democrats who have publicly said they won't be at Friday's ceremony: The civil rights icon declared last week that he would boycott the event because he doesn't see Trump as a "legitimate" president in light of Russian interference. "You cannot be at home with something that you feel that is wrong," Trump "I will not attend the inauguration because conscience says it is the right thing to do," Green said in a statement, referencing Martin Luther King, Jr. "I thought long and hard about attending the Inauguration because I value our democracy and respect the office of the presidency, regardless of party.

Their race is no proxy battle, and the party is now unified around the cause of stopping Trump as he prepares to take the oath of office, the seven contenders said. Now, they are asking the party to decide the type of resume and experience that can lift the party from 2016's wreckage. There's the grassroots progressive organizer, Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota. There's the nuts-and-bolts "turnaround artist," Labor Secretary Tom Perez. Then there's Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who proudly boasts that -- unlike Ellison, who endorsed Sanders in the Democratic primary, and Perez, who was close to Clinton -- he had nothing to do with the 2016 race. They and four other candidates to become the next Democratic National Committee chair officially kicked off the race with a forum here Saturday. They are competing to lead an organization beset by accusations -- based largely on a limited debate schedule and stolen emails published by WikiLeaks -- that the DNC improperly put its thumb on the scales in the 2016 contest between Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders. Each offered plans to ease lingering tensions. Ellison said he'd hold at least one monthly chair's call with DNC members, at least one monthly regional call and at least one monthly live-streamed event connecting the party's chair with its grass roots. Perez promised to invest in and empower state-level Democratic parties, saying he would help them "take Howard Dean to scale" -- referring to the "50-state strategy" coined by the last winner of a wide-open DNC chair's race. "I believe the DNC needs a fresh start, too, and I believe that I can deliver that fresh start," Buttigieg said. The Phoenix gathering was the first of four "future forums" Democrats are holding ahead of their election of a new national chair in Atlanta in February. The race is wide open, though Ellison and Perez boast the most support from big-name party figures. All seven candidates greeted steady streams of DNC voting members, with about one in eight of the 437 who will select the next chair in attendance Saturday. For 90 minutes, the seven candidates pitched their own resumes -- but beyond approving head-nods, all but ignored each other. All agreed that Democrats need to face Trump with a united front. And that the party must make voting access a foremost priority. And that Dean's "50-state strategy," launched in 2005, is a model to which the party must return. Mostly, they stressed that -- despite Ellison's early endorsement from Sanders and support from many Sanders-aligned progressive groups, and Perez's close ties to both Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama -- the DNC race isn't a proxy for Sanders vs. Clinton, round two. "You know, people ask me, 'Are you a Clinton Democrat or a Bernie Democrat?' Guys, I grew up in South Carolina and all I've ever been is a Democrat," said Jaime Harrison, the South Carolina state chairman. Ellison made a point of name-checking Clinton before Sanders, and told the crowd he ultimately supported both candidates -- Sanders in the primary and Clinton in the general election. "We need to unify, no matter who we supported in the primary," Ellison said. "This is a 'where were you?' moment, and that's why I got in the race," Perez added. "United, we will be able to fight back and fight back successfully," said New Hampshire state chairman Ray Buckley. Buttigieg offered himself as a clean break from 2016 -- and a voice from the heart of Trump country who could speak to the concerns of the working-class voters who have bolted from the Democratic Party. "A lot of the people who live right down the street from me know he's not a good guy. They voted for him anyway," Buttigieg said of Trump. Democrats, he said, spent too much time hammering away at Trump and not enough communicating with voters who "were saying, who's talking about me?" The 34-year-old mayor is a Rhodes Scholar, Afghanistan veteran and openly gay elected official in a conservative state. Buttigieg said he "started 2017 in a deer blind with my boyfriend's father." There's a reason none of the Democratic candidates wants to cast the race as Sanders vs. Clinton, part two: It would make winning the race much more difficult. Ellison knows opposition from Clinton- and Obama-aligned forces would put a hard cap on his potential support -- part of why his campaign played up the endorsement of Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. Perez, meanwhile, knows that with several other candidates in the race, being the establishment pick isn't enough -- and that the "establishment" label is a trap in a party that has moved rapidly to the left. The other candidates' belief is that both Ellison and Perez will eventually top out shy of the votes they'd need, and a third alternative acceptable to all the party's factions will emerge. Also in the race are Idaho Democratic Party executive director Sally Boynton Brown and Fox News analyst Jehmu Greene. "I'm sure," Greene joked, "a lot of you are sitting out there saying, 'Jeh-who?'" There was some evidence that the 2016 tensions haven't eased entirely. Boynton Brown brought props -- including a giant clear globe ornament that she said should represent the party's communication, rather than what she called a siloed structure that exists today -- and called for the creation of a "grievance council" within the DNC. "Until we start actually looking at who has issues with each other and bringing it down to the individual level," she said, "we're not going to solve this." "Until we start actually looking at who has issues with each other and bringing it down to the individual level," she said, "we're not going to solve this." ©China's Foreign Ministry firmly pushed back Saturday against President-elect Donald Trump's suggestion that the "One China" policy on Taiwan is negotiable, calling it the "political foundation" of the relationship between the US and China. China views Taiwan as a renegade province and, since 1979, the US has acknowledged Beijing's claim that Taiwan is part of China, with US-China relations governed by a set of protocols known as the "One China" policy. "The 'One China' principle is the political foundation of Sino-US relations and it is non-negotiable. We urge the relevant side in the US to recognize the high sensitivity of the Taiwan issue and abide by the pledges by successive US administrations from both parties," spokesman Lu Kang said. He was responding to a question about Trump's remarks Friday in "The pledges include adopting the 'One China' policy, adhering to the principles in the three Sino-US joint communiques and properly handling the Taiwan issue. Only doing so would prevent the healthy and stable development of Sino-US relations as well as bilateral cooperation in major areas from being affected," Lu added. The Chinese official highlighted the international community's view on the issue in a statement. "There is only one China in the world. Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory and the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate government representing China," Lu said. "These are facts recognized by the international community and no one can change this."

The group of leading human rights proponents cited the President-elect's campaign rhetoric, as well as specific platforms on which he campaigned. "His campaign floated proposals that would harm millions of people, including plans to engage in massive deportations of immigrants, to curtail women's rights and media freedoms, and to use torture," reads The statement adds: "Unless Trump repudiates these proposals, his administration risks committing massive rights violations in the US and shirking a longstanding, bipartisan belief, however imperfectly applied, in a rights-based foreign policy agenda." A message left with Trump's transition team was not immediately returned Saturday. The report said Trump's election "capped a campaign marked by misogynistic, xenophobic, and racist rhetoric and Trump's embrace of policies that would cause tremendous harm to vulnerable communities, contravene the United States' core human rights obligations, or both. Trump's campaign proposals included deporting millions of unauthorized immigrants, changing US law to allow torture of terrorism suspects and 'load[ing] up' the Guantanamo Bay detention facility." On torture, it's been widely speculated whether the President-elect -- who once said the US should go In November, Trump said his pick for secretary of defense, James Mattis, "I'm not saying it changed my mind. Look, we have people that are chopping off heads and drowning people in steel cages and we're not allowed to waterboard. But I'll tell you what, I was impressed by that answer," Trump told The New York Times. In confirmation hearings this week, Trump's choices for CIA director and secretary of Department of Homeland Security -- Also this week, former CIA Director David Petraeus told CNN's Christiane Amanpour Human Rights Watch's report also cites Trump's proposal to deport up to 3 million undocumented immigrants with criminal records quickly after taking office. The group warned that "any push to rapidly deport millions of undocumented immigrants would almost certainly exacerbate abusive conditions of detention in a sprawling system with poor oversight, and further undermine already weak due process protections." The organization attributes Trump's political success to a rising authoritarian populist movement happening around the globe. "The rise of populism poses a profound threat to human rights," the group's executive director, Kenneth Roth, said in statement. "Trump and various politicians in Europe seek power through appeals to racism, xenophobia, misogyny, and nativism. They all claim that the public accepts violations of human rights as supposedly necessary to secure jobs, avoid cultural change, or prevent terrorist attacks. In fact, disregard for human rights offers the likeliest route to tyranny."

The demonstrations came at two separate events. At Washington's historic Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church, protesters made clear their objections to Trump's immigration policies, vowing to mobilize the Latino vote in upcoming elections. At the other event, a march organized by the Rev. Al Sharpton's National Action Network and more than a dozen other groups, speakers criticized Trump's nomination of Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions to lead the Justice Department, fearing that he will reverse Obama administration policies on civil rights. Marchers also demanded action on social justice issues, including mass incarceration and voting rights, while also honoring the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr., whose birthday is commemorated this weekend ahead of Monday's federal holiday. "Our communities feel under attack," Sulma Arias of the Fair Immigration Reform Movement said at the immigration protest. "The day after the election, kids were waking up in the morning afraid to go to school because of the tension that this election caused and the rhetoric used in this election." Those packed into the church were joined by allies at around 70 similar events nationwide, according to Fernandaxe2x80x8e Durand of the advocacy group CASA. "Many who are like me feel ashamed of their status," said 19-year-old Max Kim, who came to the US from South Korea at age 5 and learned of his undocumented status when in high school. "We cannot be afraid of standing up for ourselves because that only allows the ignorance and hatred to go unchecked. Silence is no longer our safety." Attendees voiced concerns that the end of President Barack Obama's tenure meant the end of protections like the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program for young people without legal status. Candidate Trump at one point advocated for a "deportation force" to remove those without legal status, though House Speaker Paul Ryan told CNN this week Trump is more concerned with "the people who are violent criminals, repeat offenders who keep coming back in." "One thing we're going to make clear to Mr. Donald Trump is that every year, 1 million Latinos turn 18," said Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Illinois, referring to US citizens. "And we're going to register them to vote." At the immigration rally, civil, political and religious leaders pledged to speak up and mobilize supporters, even as the comprehensive immigration reform they may desire appears out of reach for the near future. "We're here to stay and we're ready to say we're not going to get pushed around as immigrants," said Durand of CASA. Meanwhile, thousands braved rain and cold to march from the nearby Washington Monument to the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial to send a message in support of civil rights and social justice. The march, which was co-sponsored by the NAACP, was capped by a rally in Washington that attracted speakers from advocacy groups, the local government and the Senate. Among the speakers were Sharpton, Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon, President of the National Urban League Marc Morial, and Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser. Cornell Williams Brooks, president of the NAACP, had strong words for Trump. Responding to Trump's Sharpton promised action. "We are going to go to senators' offices and we are going to visit them right before the votes for Mr. Sessions," he said. Evoking the civil rights leader himself, Sharpton urged the crowd to join him. "We need to make some house calls. We need to stay a little while. And we need to stay in their office while they're on the floor voting here because Dr. King died fighting for these rights," he said. "We need to make some house calls.

A publicist for the the "Dreamgirls" diva said in a statement Saturday that Holliday, who was slated to sing at an inaugural event on Thursday, changed her tune after the inauguration committee pre-emptively announced her appearance before she decided to perform. The statement also cited outcry from fans and people in the LGBT community who expressed disappointment at her participation. "It was presented to her as a concert that would heal the wounds of the election season. She was asked to perform 'Hard Times Come No More,' originally recorded by Bob Dylan. The inaugural committee released the information before she officially made a decision," Holliday's publicist, Bill Carpenter, said in a statement. "Her rep also says that upon the (announcement), Holliday started getting letters from fans that they were disappointed. The LGBTQ community, amongst others, were some that were most upset. In the past, her rep Bill Carpenter explains that she performed for Pres. Reagan, George W. Bush, George H. W. Bush, and (Bill) Clinton, but when Jennifer saw the outcry, she pulled out of the inauguration." Asked for comment, Boris Epshteyn, the director of communications for Trump's inaugural committee, simply said in a statement, "As Americans from across the country unite to celebrate the 58th Presidential Inaugural, we are humbled by the outpouring of support we are receiving and are honored to have so many world-class performers taking part in this historic celebration of freedom and democracy." "In light of the information pointed out to me via the Daily Beast article on yesterday, my only choice must now be to stand with the LGBT Community and to state unequivocally that I WILL NOT PERFORM FOR THE WELCOME CONCERT OR FOR ANY OF THE INAUGURATION FESTIVITIES!" Holliday writes in the letter. Last month, "This is not Woodstock," Epshteyn said. "It's not summer jam. It's not a concert." The committee has since booked some high-profile groups, including Toby Keith, The Rockettes, The Mormon Tabernacle Choir and Jackie Evancho, to preform for the inaugural ceremonies. ©President-elect Donald Trump harshly responded to civil rights icon and Georgia Rep. John Lewis on Saturday, calling him "all talk" and "no action" after Lewis said Trump was not a "legitimate" president. "Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results. All talk, talk, talk - no action or results. Sad," Trump tweeted Saturday, which happened to fall on the weekend of the Martin Luther King Jr. federal holiday. Trump later doubled down on his criticism -- though he did not take aim at Lewis' district -- tweeting Saturday night: "Congressman John Lewis should finally focus on the burning and crime infested inner-cities of the U.S. I can use all the help I can get!" Lewis -- an ally of King who was brutally beaten by police in Selma, Alabama, in 1965 while marching for civil rights -- represents a Georgia district that includes most of Atlanta. On the campaign trail, Trump regularly decried crime in urban areas while pledging to revitalize neighborhoods primarily populated by black Americans. A Hillary Clinton supporter, Lewis criticized Trump's ascension to head of state due to Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 election. "I don't see this President-elect as a legitimate president," the long-serving Democrat told NBC News' Chuck Todd in a clip released Friday. It was an astonishing rebuke by a sitting member of Congress toward an incoming President. Trump, however, largely launched his political career by calling into question the legitimacy of President Barack Obama's presidency by repeatedly suggesting he wasn't born in the United States. Cornell William Brooks, the president of the NAACP, said Trump's remarks were disrespectful and called on him to apologize. "By disrespecting @repjohnlewis, @realDonaldTrump dishonored Lewis' sacrifice & demeaned Americans & the rights, he nearly died 4. Apologize," Brooks tweeted, including an image of a bloodied Lewis taken during the Civil Rights Era. Donna Brazile, the interim head of the Democratic National Committee, denounced Trump's remarks and said at a DNC gathering in Phoenix that Lewis "took action." "He took action from marching from Selma to Montgomery. He took action in marching toward men wielding clubs across the Pettus Bridge. They fractured his skull because of the color of his skin. But John Lewis never stopped marching for justice and equality for all people," she said. Meanwhile, Democratic members of Congress, highlighting Lewis' contributions to the civil rights movement, swiftly condemned Trump. "Ahead of #MLKday2017, let us remember that many have tried to silence @repjohnlewis over the years. All have failed," tweeted House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. California Sen. Kamala Harris said Lewis doesn't deserve to be attacked by Trump. "John Lewis is an icon of the Civil Rights Movement who is fearless in the pursuit of justice and equality. He deserves better than this," she tweeted. Rep. Keith Ellison, who is vying to become the Democratic National Committee chairman, said Trump has "no clue" who Lewis is. ".@repjohnlewis knows true sacrifice. @realDonaldTrump has no clue. When cluelessness collides with power oppression results. Resistance," the Minnesota lawmaker said. And Republican Sen. Ben Sasse, a frequent Trump critic, praised Lewis, "John Lewis and his 'talk' have changed the world." Republican Congressman Justin Amash also chimed in with advice for the President-elect, writing on Twitter: "Dude, just stop." By Saturday evening, Lewis was fundraising off Trump's comments. "Today, Donald Trump attacked me on Twitter. He said that I'm 'all talk' and 'no action,' " Lewis wrote. "I've been beaten bloody, tear-gassed, fighting for what's right for America. I've marched at Selma with Dr. King. Sometimes that's what it takes to move our country in the right direction." He continued: "Some leaders reject decades of progress and want to return to the dark past, when the power of law was used to deny the freedoms protected by the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and its Amendments. "I remember when segregation was the law of the land that ordered our society in the Deep South. The forces of law and order in Alabama were so strong that to take a stand against this injustice, we had to be willing to sacrifice our lives for our cause. "It took massive, well-organized, non-violent dissent and criticism of this great nation and its laws to move toward a greater sense of equality in America." Lewis is one of an increasing number of Democratic lawmakers "You cannot be at home with something that you feel that is wrong," Lewis told NBC News. California Rep. Barbara Lee said earlier this week she will spend the day organizing. "Donald Trump has proven that his administration will normalize the most extreme fringes of the Republican Party. On Inauguration Day, I will not be celebrating. I will be organizing and preparing for resistance," she said Thursday in a statement. Reps. Luis Gutierrez of Illinois, Jared Huffman of California and Katherine Clark of Massachusetts, are also boycotting the historic event. "I cannot go to (the) inauguration of a man who's going to appoint people to the Supreme Court and turn back the clock on women and turn back the clock on immigrants and the safety and freedom that we fought for them," Gutierrez said last month on CNN's "New Day."

Mukasey, who served under former President George W. Bush, insisted in an interview with CNN's Michael Smerconish that Comey's investigation "was mismanaged from the get-go." "He crossed several lines. I think it was not his function to call to question whether she should or should not be prosecuted. That was for the attorney general or her designee, and I think he went way out of his lane," he said. As for Comey's controversial move to notify Congress 11 days before the election of newly discovered emails that were thought to be potentially related to Clinton's server, Mukasey questioned his judgment. "When he held the press conference -- and remember that Secretary Clinton's campaign billed that as a clean bill of health -- he was exonerating her. Then he then felt he had to correct the record, there might be more. Then he had to re-correct the record. It was like watching a car gradually go out of control," Mukasey said. Asked by Smerconish if he felt the "big picture" solution should be that Comey hands in his resignation, Mukasey was clear. "Big picture, I think probably so," he said. "And even bigger picture," he continued, "we ought to get a complete soup-to-nuts account of what happened." Mukasey suggested that Trump could also help to finally close a chapter on the investigation. "Maybe at the end of it, President Trump will pardon Secretary Clinton, which would be both poetic and prosaic justice, and we can all get onto things like the economy, Russia and Iran," he said.

Faced with a stinging loss at the polls, a conservative-leaning Supreme Court and an incoming attorney general who testified this week about the dangers of voter fraud, Democrats are starting early to change the legal terrain in four years. On Thursday, former Attorney General Eric Holder vowed, jokingly, "to make redistricting sexy." The comments came at a news conference held to launch a new group called the National Democratic Redistricting Committee. Holder said Obama has told him that he wants to dedicate a part of his post administration life to the issue. The plans discussed are two-fold: a comprehensive redistricting strategy ahead of the 2020 census and new efforts to combat laws that progressives believe are veiled attempts to suppress the vote. The effort comes as Republicans celebrate their electoral victory, and the President-elect plans to nominate a new justice to a Supreme Court that has redistricting and voter ID cases in the pipeline. "There are critically important cases coming to a head in the courts on redistricting, strict Voter Id and other restrictions on voter access that will determine whether American citizens are able to have their voices heard at the polls to demand fair representation," said Liz Kennedy of the liberal Center for American Progress. The focus is on the state level. Each decade after the census, it is the state legislators and the governors in the majority of the states who redraw the maps of electoral districts. Around the last census, Republicans made heavy investments in state legislative elections that resulted in Republicans controlling the process in many states. "We have to raise the consciousness of people who are in the progressive community to understand that coming out every four years and campaigning hard for a presidential election is not nearly enough," Holder said. Holder said he thinks Democrats have been paying too much attention to presidential elections. "Presidential elections are obviously important," he said, "but we lost sight of the fact that if you want to have a representative Congress you have to make sure that you have state legislatures that are going to yield a representative Congress, and we also lost sight of the fact that a lot of governing in this country happens at state and local level." Holder said some of those maps were drawn and manipulated by legislatures to favor the party in power. The process is called "gerrymandering." "We have always had gerrymandering," Holder said. "Now we have gerrymandering on steroids." Holder laid out a three-prong strategy to attack the issue. It includes working on key elections, providing resources to mount legal challenges and supporting ballot initiatives to change the process. Carolyn Fiddler, spokeswoman for the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, welcomes the effort. "The final goal is to prevent another round of extreme Republican gerrymandering," she said. "Having Democrats in place to have a hand on those map-drawing plans will prevent that." Joshua A. Douglas, an election law expert at the University of Kentucky Law School, said that while both sides try to draw maps to their advantage, last time around, Republicans did a much better job of winning state legislative seats. "So far, the Supreme Court has refused to stop partisan gerrymandering and has only stepped in for charges of racial gerrymandering or to ensure districts of equal population," he said. Of the new efforts by Holder, Douglas said the Republicans are likely to say "good luck drawing maps, but if they are unfair, we will sue." Marc Elias, who served as Hillary Clinton's election lawyer, spent much of the last campaign fighting back efforts by Republicans on issues on voter access, such as strict voter ID requirements and cutbacks on early voting. "The election is over, but we have not seen a let up of Republican efforts to make voting harder," he said on a call hosted by the American Constitution Society. In general, Republicans push for new restrictions on voting so as to combat what they say is a problem of voter fraud. Democrats ridicule the notion that voter fraud exists and say the laws are a veiled attempt to suppress the vote. During his confirmation hearing for attorney general this week, Sessions reignited the debate. "Do you agree with President-elect Trump that millions of fraudulent votes were cast in the presidential election?" Democratic Sen. Al Franken asked. Sessions responded: "I don't know what the President-elect meant or was thinking when he made that comment or what facts he may have had to justify his statement. I would just say that every election needs to be managed closely and we need to ensure that there is integrity in it." The sentiment worries Democrats who know that Sessions is poised to shift resources in the Department of Justice away from voting rights toward issues brought up during the campaign such as immigration control and drug enforcement. They are well aware that in 2013, a closely divided court struck down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act. During the campaign, Democrats had hoped that they might be able to fill the seat of Justice Antonin Scalia in an effort to reduce the damage of that opinion. Now that seat will go to someone in the mold of the conservative legend. The voting wars show no signs of letting up. Indeed, one of Trump's first moves after the election was to appoint his election lawyer, Donald F. McGahn II, to the plum job of White House counsel. And one of McGahn's first tasks: help the incoming President pick a Supreme Court justice to fill the current vacancy. The voting wars show no signs of letting up.

Trump reiterated plans to implement what he calls "extreme vetting" of people from the Muslim world. When asked if he would impose similar restrictions on Europe, the President-elect was noncommittal. "That could happen. But we will see," he said. The interview, conducted on Friday by Bild and the Times of London, covered a wide range of international questions and conflicts. Michael Gove, one of the former leaders of UK's Brexit campaign, which Trump often praised during the election season, conducted the interview for The Times. Asked why he thought the Brexit campaign was successful, Trump blamed loose borders and concerns about the effects of immigration. He also tied it to US security concerns. "We don't want people from Syria to come to us when we don't know who they are," Trump said, pledging immediate action to tighten American border controls. According to the interview posted by the Times of London, Trump also criticized the Obama administration's response to the civil war in Syria, suggesting it missed an opportunity to head off what has become a humanitarian catastrophe. "It's a very bad thing, we had a chance to do something when we had the line in the sand and... nothing happened. That was the only time. And now, it's sort of very late. It's too late," he said. "But Aleppo was nasty. I mean when you see them shooting old ladies walking out of town -- they can't even walk and they're shooting 'em -- it almost looks like they're shooting 'em for sport. Ah no, that's... a terrible situation." The government of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who will run for a fourth term in elections this year, has been among the most open to Syrian refugees -- and Trump suggested those policies have been a "big mistake." Asked whom he trusted more, Merkel, a longtime US ally, or Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump called it a draw -- at least for now. "I start off trusting both, but let see how long that lasts," he said. "May not last long at all." "I start off trusting both, but let see how long that lasts," he said. "May not last long at all." ©Staffing shortages in a Trump White House? A Supreme Court "nuclear option." And some curious polling in New York City. It's all part of this week's "Inside Politics" forecast, where you get tomorrow's headlines today. Donald Trump bragged throughout the presidential campaign that his team was small but effective. It is a lean approach some see him bringing to the White House as well, at least early on. And that is raising some concern. For example, the President-elect has filled the top jobs on his National Security Council staff. But Julie Pace of the Associated Press reports that many of the NSC staff jobs remain vacant just days before the inauguration. "The big-name jobs are obviously filled, but at the National Security Council and some of the other White House agencies people are expecting a lot of empty desks when he moves in on Friday," Pace said Sunday on CNN's "Inside Politics." "Again, this isn't something that the public will always see. But these behind-the-scenes jobs at the White House are really crucial to keeping operations running, especially in crisis moments. " Trump is promising to send his Supreme Court pick to Congress in the first few weeks, and Republicans wants to fast-track the confirmation process. But Democrats are still angry that the GOP refused to even give a hearing to President Obama's choice for the vacancy left by the death last year of Justice Antonin Scalia. And there is talk of exacting a bit of revenge once Trump settles on a pick. So Senate Republicans are not ruling out the "nuclear option" -- DC parlance for changing the rules so that it takes only 51 votes for confirmation instead of 60. CNN's Manu Raju says it is not the GOP's first choice, but it is on the table. "Democrats, when they changed the rules in 2013, they left in place the rule for filibustering Supreme Court nominees, and at the time Republicans criticized him relentlessly. But now that it's happened, Republicans say it could happen once again, " Raju said. "I talked to Senate Republican leaders, including Senator John Cornyn, who said that first they will try to pick off moderate Dems, red state Dems. "And if those don't decide to vote for Donald Trump's nominee, wait for the nuclear option to be a possibility. So watch for that fight to really shape up because they will do whatever it takes to get Donald Trump his nominee." As a candidate, Donald Trump said rival Ted Cruz was beholden to Goldman Sachs. The Wall Street investment firm was also a foil in Trump's rhetoric suggesting the system was rigged and that big banks and career politicians worked hand in hand to help themselves and hurt the little guy. But that was then. Now Lisa Lerer of the Associated Press says that Goldman alumni are getting starring roles in the Trump administration. "He's tapped six advisers from the bank. His aides say that there's no hypocrisy here, that ... working for the bank and the actual bank are different things," Lerer said. "We'll have to see if voters in Congress agree. Former Goldman Sachs partner Steve Mnuchin will be getting his confirmation hearing on Thursday, so we'll see whether this comes up." Donald Trump doesn't begin his first term until Friday, but may already be getting started on his bid to win a second. A Trump campaign committee was announced this past week. It will be located at Trump Tower in New York and led by Michael Glassner, who was a senior staffer in the 2016 Trump campaign. The announcement has piqued the curiosity of Republicans in Washington. Is it just an early start on the 2020 race? Another competing power center in Trumpland? Or a place to employ 2016 Trump loyalists who aren't welcome in Washington? Those are among the questions being asked. The one thing that is certain: Trump operates at his own rhythm. Hillary Clinton loyalists say she is done running for public office. But some are wondering about whether Clinton might consider running for mayor of New York City. Democrat Bill de Blasio is the incumbent, and again, Team Clinton says she isn't interested. But that hasn't stopped pollsters from testing the idea, says Mary Katharine Ham of The Federalist. "I heard from two people in New York yesterday that they were polled about mayoral issues in New York City and that one of the questions was a head-to-head with de Blasio and Hillary Clinton," Ham said. "Hillary Clinton, should she want to do that, should have some data in the near future."

The CIA chief defended his agency and said in a Sunday interview with Fox News' Chris Wallace that the CIA was not trying to harm the incoming President or his team. "There is no interest in undermining the President-elect and the team coming in. It's our responsibility to make sure they understand exactly the dangers that are out there," Brennan said. Trump has slammed the intelligence community repeatedly over the past few weeks in response to what he said was unfair coverage caused by leaked information from intelligence officials. On Sunday evening he even pointed fingers directly at the CIA director over Twitter. ".@FoxNews 'Outgoing CIA Chief, John Brennan, blasts Pres-Elect Trump on Russia threat. Does not fully understand.' Oh really, couldn't do...much worse - just look at Syria (red line), Crimea, Ukraine and the build-up of Russian nukes. Not good! Was this the leaker of Fake News?" he wrote. In response to the President-elect's tweets the CIA told CNN late Sunday evening it had no comment. First on Twitter and then at his first news conference since July, Trump likened the leaks to "Nazi Germany." Brennan called the Nazi reference "outrageous." "I do take great umbrage at that, and there is no basis for Mr. Trump to point fingers at the intelligence community for leaking information that was already available publicly," Brennan said. Brennan bristled at Trump's public displays of contempt for the intelligence community and said Trump needed to understand his words could undermine national security. "If he doesn't have confidence in the intelligence community, what signal does that send to our partners and allies, as well as our adversaries?" Brennan said. The CIA director and former deputy national security adviser to Obama also warned Trump on Russia, saying he did not believe Trump understood the threat of Russia, while also saying he hoped the Trump administration would be able to see an improvement in the US-Russia relationship. "I don't think he has a full appreciation of Russian capabilities, Russia's intentions," Brennan said, adding that Trump "does not yet" fully appreciate what embracing Russia might mean. And with just a few days remaining in office, Brennan looked ahead to the incoming national security team, naming Trump's picks for secretary of defense, CIA director and secretary of homeland security. "They are the ones that are going to be able to give him some wise counsel about what he needs to do and not be very spontaneous," he said. "It's more than just about Mr. Trump. It's about the United States of America." ©Secretary of State John Kerry visited on Saturday the very site where he killed a Vietnamese soldier in battle almost 50 years earlier, when his Swift Boat was attacked by the Viet Cong. Kerry was a young US Navy officer at the time, in his mid-twenties, and the battle in the Mekong river earned him a Silver Star. In his fourth visit to Vietnam as secretary of state, Kerry met with Vo Ban Tam, a 70-year-old veteran who was part of a team that ambushed the secretary's Swift Boat in 1969. Through an interpreter, Ban Tam explained that he knew the man Kerry killed, it was his 24-year-old friend and fellow soldier, Ba Thanh. Kerry and Ban Tam shook hands, and Kerry presented one of his commemorative Challenge Coins to Ban Tam. "Today I met Vo Ban Tam, a former VC enemy who farms shrimp and crab on the same #Mekong river we once fought over," Kerry tweeted, expressing how powerful it is that veterans from both sides can now get together and work on strengthening U.S. -- Vietnam relations. After his return from Vietnam, where he was also awarded the Bronze Star and three Purple Hearts, Kerry became a leader of the group Vietnam Veterans Against the War, speaking to members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and making headlines at a Washington protest by disposing of his medals on the Capitol lawn. He later admitted that the medals belonged to someone else.

John Lewis Sunday against recent attacks from President-elect Donald Trump, but he did not agree with his claim that Trump is not "legitimate." McDonough twice referenced President Barack Obama's comments, including during his farewell speech in Chicago last week, that described Trump as being "freely elected." "The President has made very clear that he believes that (Trump) is the freely elected president," McDonough told CNN's Jake Tapper on Sunday's "State of the Union." "He will be inaugurated on Friday and he will come into office, hopefully, strengthened by the kind of transition that we've tried to run in this White House." But Obama's top aide also said the incoming administration should seek out the civil rights leader as a partner -- not an enemy. "My hope would be that the President-elect would reach out to somebody as consequential and somebody who is such a leader as John Lewis, who has done so many things over the course of his life, to try to work this out," McDonough said. "And hopefully not just reach out to him, but pursue some of the policies that Mr. Lewis has literally fought, bled and gone to jail for over the course of his remarkable life." On Saturday morning, The attack, coming on the weekend of Martin Luther King Jr. Day, set off a firestorm of condemnations from Democrats and some Republicans. But Trump said Sunday morning Democrats criticizing him were just jealous. "The Democrats are most angry that so many Obama Democrats voted for me," he wrote just after 9 a.m. ET.

Asked by Fox News' Chris Wallace about contact between Trump or Trump's team and the Kremlin, and the former Indiana governor denied there had been any, writing off the whole line of questioning as a "distraction." "Of course not. Why would there be any contact between the campaign?" Pence told Wallace on "Fox News Sunday." "This is all a distraction, and it's all part of a narrative to delegitimatize the election and to question the legitimacy of (Trump's) presidency." Asked again on CBS' "Face the Nation" by John Dickerson, Pence once again said "of course" there had not been contact between the Trump campaign and Russia. FBI Director James Comey Pence was also asked about contact between retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, Trump's pick for national security adviser, and the Russian ambassador to Washington Sergey Kislyak.

John Lewis Sunday as a civil rights icon, but said he's not "immune" to criticism from political opponents. "John Lewis isn't in a position where there can't be a healthy debate. Because he's a civil rights icon, shouldn't make him immune" to criticism, the Kentucky senator told Jake Tapper on CNN's "State of the Union." On Saturday, President-elect Donald Trump responded to Lewis' questioning of his legitimacy by unleashing a string of attacks on Twitter, calling the Georgia congressman -- who was beaten and nearly killed in Selma, Alabama in 1965 while marching for voting rights -- "all talk" and "no action." Paul added that Lewis is, like his Democratic colleagues, a fair subject for criticism from across the aisle. "John Lewis is a partisan," he said. "I have a great deal of respect for him, but he is a partisan and I disagree with him on issues. I should be able to honestly disagree with him and not have it all come back to I have no appreciation for a civil rights icon because of this and I think that's the part I think somehow is unfair in this." Vice President-elect Mike Pence said in a separate interview he was "deeply disappointed" to see Lewis question Trump's legitimacy. "Donald Trump has the right to defend himself," Pence told Chris Wallace on "Fox News Sunday." "When someone of John Lewis' stature, someone who is not only an icon in the civil rights movement, but also by somebody who by virtue of his sacrifice on that day we know as bloody Sunday ... for someone of his stature to use terms like this -- that (Trump) is not a legitimate president -- it's just deeply disappointing to me." Pence said he hopes Lewis reconsiders his decision to skip inauguration. Incoming chief of staff Reince Priebus called Lewis' comments "incredibly disappointing." "We look up to John Lewis and his historic contribution to civil rights and voting rights," Priebus told George Stephanopoulos on ABC's "This Week." "It's incredibly disappointing, and I think it's irresponsible, for people like himself to question the legitimacy of the next United States president."

Rand Paul on Sunday unveiled the broad strokes of his Obamacare replacement package, a measure he again said Republicans must pass "on the same day as we do repeal." "We've had six years to complain and we have complained -- I've been one of those complaining about Obamacare," he told CNN's Jake Tapper on "State of the Union." "The replacement bill that we put together, our goal is to insure the most amount of people, give access to the most amount of people, at least the amount of cost." Republicans have been at loggerheads over the timing and execution of their promise to repeal Obamacare and replace it with a cheaper alternative that will not disrupt the insurance market and leave millions of Americans without coverage. "I completely disagree with those who say we either don't have a plan or have to wait," Paul told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Monday. "There are about 50 replacement bills that have been out there for years." On Sunday, Paul gave a preview of his and argued that in requiring insurers to offer more robust plans, Obamacare drove up prices and pushed people out of the market. "One of the key reforms that we will do is, we're going to legalize the sale of inexpensive insurance," he said. "That means getting rid of the Obamacare mandates on what you can buy. We are going to help people save through health savings accounts, as well as a tax credit." Those less expensive options, which were prevalent on the market before the 2010 reform was signed into law, would offer less robust care but also, as supporters argue, be more neatly tailored to what consumers view to be their specific needs. Under Paul's program, the bargaining power created by the state and federal exchanges would be replaced with a provision that allows individuals and associations like small businesses to create their own markets. "There's no reason why (a business owner) with four employees shouldn't be able to join with hundreds and hundreds of other businesses that are small to become a large entity to get leverage to bring your prices down," Paul told Tapper. He added that those negotiations with insurance companies could also be used to guarantee the availability of policies that "can't cancel you and guarantees the issue of the insurance even if you get sick." Paul's plan did not directly address the future of states that signed on for expanded Medicaid offered as part of Obamacare. Kentucky, which had a Democratic governor when the law went into effect, was among those to accept the funds. The majority of the more than 400,000 Kentuckians insured under the law were brought into the fold by Medicaid expansion. "That's the big question," Paul said of their fate. "And I don't think that's going to be in the replacement aspect." The future of Medicaid expansion would then be decided during the repeal process, which will run through a budget reconciliation vote -- one that requires only a simple majority for passage. "What we have to decide is what can be kept and what can't be kept," Paul said, suggesting that the states should raise taxes if they want to maintain their current expenditure levels. He also described the current system as having come about as the result of "deceitfulness" by the Obama administration, which Paul accused of having misled the public about the federal government's ability to foot the bill. "So I'd say that if you want to have more Medicaid you should say we're going to have to have higher taxes to pay for it," he said. "So I'd say that if you want to have more Medicaid you should say we're going to have to have higher taxes to pay for it," he said. ©President-elect Donald Trump Trump's tweets came in response to To be sure, Atlanta, which makes up most of Lewis' district, is a snapshot of two extremes.

Trump Towers never came to be, however, and went into foreclosure after the 2008 recession. Since that time, Atlanta's real estate market has rebounded.

Trump did not reveal any details of how he'd accomplish this daunting task, noting that he is waiting for his health secretary nominee, Tom Price, to be confirmed. Price is appearing before the Senate Health, Education, Labor & Pensions Committee on Wednesday, but his hearing before the crucial Senate Finance Committee has yet to be scheduled. Trump's weekend interview with The Washington Post comes just after Congress took its first steps to dismantle President Barack Obama's landmark health care reform law. The House on Friday followed the Senate in approving a budget resolution that would repeal major portions of the Affordable Care Act. Committees in both chambers will now work out the details of repealing and replacing the law. However, after nearly seven years of vowing to repeal Obamacare, Republicans are fracturing over how to actually go about doing it. Some want to slow down the repeal effort until a replacement plan is unveiled. Trump is making some big promises: His insurance reform will cover more people and cost less money. "We're going to have insurance for everybody," Trump told The Washington Post. "There was a philosophy in some circles that if you can't pay for it, you don't get it. That's not going to happen with us." "[They] can expect to have great health care. It will be in a much simplified form. Much less expensive and much better," he said. Three senior GOP Hill sources working on health care legislation told CNN Tuesday that they don't know what Trump meant by the remark about insurance for "everyone", and they say they are frustrated that Trump is emphasizing the wrong thing. They want to be talking about lowering costs, not expanding coverage -- which is what Democrats focus on. And they say the Hill is in the dark on any bill that Trump may be working on, as they plan their own strategy to replace the law pieces at a time. On the campaign trail, Trump promised he would "take care of everybody" and that Americans can't let "people die on the street." He also said he would press for Medicare to be allowed to negotiate drug prices. He acknowledged all these were not very Republican things to say. Congressional Republicans have shied away from saying how many people their replacement plan will insure, preferring to use the term "universal access" versus the Obamacare's "universal coverage" goal. Some 20 million people have gained coverage under Obamacare and the nation's uninsured rate has dropped to 8.9% in the first half of 2016, from 14.4% in 2013, before the Affordable Care Act's exchanges opened and Medicaid expansion took effect. Trump's promises could also set up potential conflicts between him and his health secretary nominee. Price, a Georgia representative who chairs the House Budget Committee, has authored his own replacement plan that does not have universal coverage as its primary goal. Trump did not say how his proposal compares to that of House Speaker Paul Ryan, who has also promised to unveil a detailed replacement plan in coming weeks. Republicans have long slammed Obamacare, saying its high premiums and deductibles leave enrollees feeling like the don't have insurance. They have vowed to lower the cost, primarily by lifting Obamacare's insurance regulations that require carriers to provide comprehensive benefits. Ryan and Price have unveiled frameworks for replacement plans that rely on tax credits based on enrollees' age, not income. However, health policy experts have said those credits will have to be generous in order to make coverage affordable. And that could run afoul of Republicans' promise to lower federal spending on health care. ©President-elect Donald Trump's choice to be labor secretary has voiced second thoughts in recent days, because of a relentless barrage of criticism from Democrats, labor unions and other liberal groups, a business ally and GOP sources tell CNN. Andy Puzder is the CEO of the company that owns the Hardees and Carl's Jr. fast food chains. "He may be bailing," said a Republican source plugged into the Trump transition effort. "He is not into the pounding he is taking, and the paperwork." A Trump transition spokesperson declined to comment, but later pointed to a tweet made by Puzder after CNN's report, which said: "I am looking forward to my hearing." Democrats and their allies have launched an aggressive campaign against Puzder, who opposes key Democratic workplace priorities, including the goal of a $15 federal minimum wage. His required ethics and financial paperwork also has not yet been posted by the Office of Government Ethics, which makes the filings public after nominees for top federal positions detail how they plan to comply with federal ethics rules regarding financial holdings. Puzder's confirmation hearings was initially scheduled for this week. It is now on hold, and likely will not be held until next month. It is not unusual for nominees from the private sector to be taken aback by the harsh political climate that often greets new presidential appointees. To that end, two Republican sources did not dispute but cautioned against reading too much into word of second thoughts. One of them added that "Trump loves it and wants the fight," and said it was his information that senior transition officials were aware of Puzder's concerns and urging him to stay in the fight.

Barbara Lee explained Monday why she's planning on skipping Donald Trump's inauguration, saying she doesn't support the President-elect's attorney general nominee, Jeff Sessions, or incoming White House senior adviser, Steve Bannon, because of their controversial pasts. "I respect the peaceful transfer of power," she told CNN's Erin Burnett on "OutFront." "(But) how do we come together when we have a Cabinet that has been proposed that is antithetical to the human dignity of all Americans?" On January 12, Lee tweeted: "Inauguration should be a celebration. But we have nothing to celebrate on Jan 20. Instead of attending, I will be organizing." More than two dozen Democratic lawmakers are boycotting Trump's inauguration, particularly after revelations of Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 election and his rebuke of civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis on Saturday. And some members have said they will be protesting in Washington and in their districts instead. "I think that this for me is a celebration ... for me personally, I am not celebrating the swearing-in or the inauguration of someone who campaigned on such a negative campaign and wants to govern in that way as he has shown," Lee said. "I will be working to help organize a resistance to some of this agenda, such as the repeal of affordable care act ... so I'm going to continue to work and hopefully find ways where we can work together on issues that are critical."

"We haven't asked him," he told CNN's Erin Burnett on "OutFront." "He considers himself a friend of the President-elect, but it's not the venue. The venue we have for entertainment is filled out, it's perfect, it's going to be typically and traditionally American, and Kanye is a great guy but we just haven't asked him to perform. We move on with our agenda." Last month, sources told CNN the transition team was struggling to book big names for the inauguration. Boris Epshteyn, an inaugural committee spokesman, also noted the lack of A-listers appearing at the ceremony. "This is not Woodstock," Epshteyn said. "It's not summer jam. It's not a concert." The committee has since booked Toby Keith, The Rockettes, The Mormon Tabernacle Choir and Jackie Evancho, to perform for the inaugural ceremonies. Barrack added he was "disappointed" that more than two dozen Democratic lawmakers are boycotting Trump's inauguration. "Of course I'm disappointed because I think adults should play well in the sandbox," he said. "This is the President of the United States. This is not a joke. And it's not a political event. It's a tribute to America. I wish all of them would get off of it and grow up and support the President that they have." He added: "On the other hand, I love it.

Trump didn't speak to the press. When asked about the dispute between Trump and Lewis, King defended the lawmaker -- who Trump attacked as all talk and no action -- and said he has "demonstrated that he is action." "I think that in the heat of emotion a lot of things get said on both sides," King said. Trump tweeted earlier in the day about observing Martin Luther King Jr. Day. "Honor him for being the great man that he was!," Trump tweeted shortly after incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer announced that the President-elect would meet with King in New York. "Today we observe the birthday of #MartinLutherKing - @realDonaldTrump will meet with Martin Luther King III to discuss his legacy," Spicer tweeted. The meeting with King follows a weekend consumed by Trump's response to comments by Lewis, the Georgia Democrat who questioned the legitimacy of his victory. Early Saturday morning, Trump ripped Lewis -- a distinguished leader of the civil rights movement -- for being "all talk" and "no action or results." "Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to......mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results," he said. "All talk, talk, talk - no action or results. Sad!" On Monday, Lewis, who marched beside Martin Luther King Jr. and was beaten and nearly killed by state troopers in Selma, Alabama, in 1965, tweeted his praise for the slain leader. "Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was my friend, my mentor; he was like a big brother," Lewis said. Lewis, and more than 20 other Democratic lawmakers, will not be attending Trump's inauguration on Friday. "You cannot be at home with something that you feel that is wrong," he said in "You cannot be at home with something that you feel that is wrong," he said in ©Donald Trump is four days away from assuming the presidency after one of the most tumultuous transitions in modern history, setting the stage for a rocky period of dramatic change, partisan acrimony and unpredictable results. Trump will take office with far lower poll ratings than his recent predecessors, with majorities of Americans doubtful of his capacity to handle the job. He's at John Lewis became one of the most prominent Democrats to For any other incoming president, such a pile of controversies and crises would suggest an early political disaster is imminent for the new White House. But Trump broke the mold in his outsider campaign and has repeatedly shrugged off scandals and controversies that would have downed normal politicians. He appears determined to shake up conventions that have built up around the presidency for two centuries and has little time for those who say he lacks presidential demeanor. In fact, many of the political storms raging as he takes office have been instigated by Trump himself. Inciting chaos and disruption has been the key to his political career, helping him rupture the Republican establishment and win the White House. He seemingly has no plans to change tactics in the White House. "He is reinventing the modern presidency," said Timothy Naftali, a CNN presidential historian. But as Trump takes office, his signature style, designed to keep everyone off balance, is facing its most significant test. Will his confrontational, brazen approach, the prosecution of personal grudges on social media and tendency to stir disorientation prove to be a workable template for a presidency? And will his method of deliberately picking at societal fault lines work when Trump is president of all Americans? "Only time will tell whether he succeeds as a leader," said Naftali, who also teaches at New York University and warns that while Trump often plays by different rules, history will not. "We know the metrics for success haven't changed -- public opinion, bills passed, confidence around the world, confidence at home, a strong economy. All these things are the same metrics." Trump, he continued, "is reinventing the style of the presidency and every president has the right to do that. But he's going to be tested the same way." Trump will begin his administration in a deepening hole with public opinion. His approval rating stood at 44% a week before the inauguration, according to Gallup. President Barack Obama was at 83% at the equivalent moment, George W. Bush was at 61% and Bill Clinton at 68%. A Pew Research poll found that 39% of Americans approve of the way Trump has outlined his policies while a Quinnipiac poll put his approval rating at 37% last week. Gallup also found Trump under 50% on questions about whether he will handle military force wisely, how he would steer an international crisis and on his capacity to avoid major scandals in his administration. He does better over his ability to handle the economy and defend US interests abroad, but he still lags other previous incoming presidents at the equivalent time. Vice President-elect Mike Pence, however, said Trump has a mandate even as Democrats point out he lost the popular vote and question the legitimacy of his victory. "Donald Trump won a landslide election," Pence said Sunday on CBS' "Face the Nation." "The American people spoke decisively, they wanted change and I promise ... come noon this coming Friday, change really begins and we are going to make America great again." Starting from such a low base of approval gives Trump little leeway should things begin to go wrong in his administration. Presidents who get into trouble in the polls generally become less effective in molding public opinion in times of crisis and in exerting leverage on Capitol Hill. It's also notable that while Trump took care to keep his supporters on his side during his post-election "thank you" tour, he's done almost nothing to reach out to the millions of Americans who view his inauguration with anxiety. He has instead spent his transition waging personal vendettas on Twitter, castigating CNN and other media organizations while putting more credibility in the statements of Russia and Wikileaks founder Julian Assange than those of US intelligence agencies. But if Trump proves skillful at handling the presidency, it's possible his approval rating could quickly rise. And for Trump's supporters, who sent him to Washington to fundamentally dismantle the political class, Still, the President-elect could be storing up future problems that could return and haunt him later in his administration. Ethics lawyers have condemned his decision to flout the normal practice of presidents by not putting his assets in a blind trust as far short of what is necessary. Trump will hand over the running of his businesses to his sons, Eric and Donald Jr., and has pledged not to discuss them. But he will retain his financial stake, which means he can still boost his own wealth indirectly by decisions he will make as President. The President-elect will also take office beset by looming political challenges in Congress. Trump said at last week's news conference that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is calling for a "stable transition period" between the two moving parts of building a new GOP health care plan and several Republican senators are anxious about moving too quickly. Disagreements are also brewing at the heart of Trump's own cabinet. While most of his nominees appear to be heading for confirmation, clear differences emerged between the President-elect and his national security team at their hearings on Russia, torture, the Iran nuclear deal and the need to preserve US alliances. Their positions raised questions about how their conventional views would fit with a president who seems intent on disrupting foreign policy traditions. Trump tweeted on Friday that there was no reason to worry. "All of my Cabinet nominee are looking good and doing a great job. I want them to be themselves and express their own thoughts, not mine!" Traditionally, new presidents begin their administrations by using their inaugural address to call on the nation to unite after fractious political campaigns. Trump may do the same, though his scorched earth style leaves him with perhaps a bigger challenge in this area than any recent president. His handling of lingering questions about the extent of Russian interference in the election and the treatment of Hillary Clinton by the FBI could also be crucial to establishing credibility with those who oppose him. For now, however, he remains hyper sensitive to the merest suggestion that his election victory was marred by outside influences, suggesting that corrosive questions about 2016 will linger long into his presidency "What are Hillary Clinton's people complaining about with respect to the F.B.I. Based on the information they had she should never..... have been allowed to run - guilty as hell," Trump said in consecutive tweets on Friday. Former Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon said on CNN last week that such comments bode ill for Trump's presidency. "I think those tweets are just the latest indication that Donald Trump is someone very insecure in his victory," he said last week. "Every day, there are new developments and new shoes dropping, so to speak, that call into question the legitimacy of his win."

Speaking in Brussels before a meeting of EU foreign ministers, Frank-Walter Steinmeier suggested the alliance was rattled by the remarks by Trump. In a joint interview with the Times of London and the German publication Bild, Trump signaled that US foreign policy in a range of areas could be turned on its head. He suggested that sanctions imposed after Russia's annexation of Crimea could be eased in return for a deal to reduce nuclear weapons, that German Chancellor Angela Merkel had pursued "catastrophic" policies on refugees, and that his son-in-law Jared Kushner could lead a Middle East peace effort. Speaking in Berlin, Merkel shrugged off the interview, saying she would make no substantive comment before Trump was inaugurated. NATO said it was "absolutely confident" that the US would remain "committed" to the organization Trump used the interview to restate his doubts about NATO. "I said a long time ago that NATO had problems," he said in the interview. "Number one it was obsolete, because it was designed many, many years ago. "Number two the countries weren't paying what they're supposed to be paying," adding that this was unfair to the United States. Steinmeier said he had spoken with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, "who is concerned that President-elect Trump regards NATO as obsolete." He also noted Trump's position was "in contradiction" to that of James Mattis, Trump's nominee for defense secretary. NATO spokesperson Oana Lungescu pushed back against the comments. "A strong NATO is good for the United States, just as it is for Europe." But Dmitry Peskov, the press spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin, agreed with Trump's assessment of NATO, saying on Monday that "the systematic goal of this organization is confrontation." The US and European Union both imposed sanctions on Russia after it seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 -- those sanctions were extended for Trump suggested they could be eased in return for a nuclear weapons deal. "They have sanctions against Russia -- let's see if we can strike a few good deals with Russia. I think there should be less nuclear weapons and they have to be reduced significantly, that's part of it. "But there are these sanctions and Russia is suffering lots from it. But I think there are things, which lots of people can profit from. " Responding to Trump's comments Monday, the Kremlin said that "sanctions are not a question on our agenda, neither internally, nor in discussions with our international partners." Elsewhere in the interview Trump heaped praise on his son-in-law Jared Kushner, "Do you know what? Jared is such a good guy; he will conclude an Israel agreement that no one else can do. You know, he is a natural talent, he is amazing, he is a natural talent," Trump said, according to Bild. Trump set his sights on German Chancellor Angela Merkel, calling her "by far the most important leader" in Europe while tearing into her immigration policies, labeling them "catastrophic." "I have great respect for her, I felt she was a great leader, I think she made one very catastrophic mistake and that was taking all these illegals and taking all these people where ever they come from and nobody really knows where they come from." Merkel, who will run for a fourth term in elections this year, has stood firm on Germany's position of accepting nearly all asylum seekers found to be legitimate refugees. Germany took in more than one million refugees in 2015, making it the most open country in Europe to asylum seekers. Speaking at a joint press conference with New Zealand Prime Minister Bill English on Monday, Merkel said she would not comment before Trump's inauguration. "We have known what his position is for some time, and my position is also known," she said. An enthusiastic Trump praised Britain's impending exit from the European Union as being "so smart." "I think Brexit is going to end up being a great thing," Trump said to his interviewer from the Times, Michael Gove, one of the former leaders of the Brexit campaign, and a sitting member of the UK Parliament. Asked why he thought the UK's Brexit campaign was successful, Trump blamed loose borders and concerns about the effects of immigration. He also tied it to US security concerns. "Countries want their own identity. The UK wanted its own identity. I do believe this, if they hadn't been forced to take in all of the refugees so many, with all the problems that entails, you wouldn't have a Brexit... it probably could've worked out." According to the Times, Trump would offer Britain a "fair" trade deal with America within weeks of taking office. (In fact, Britain will not be able to begin negotiating new trade deals until the Brexit process is complete). He also revealed that he was inviting Prime Minister Theresa May to visit him "right after" he gets into the White House Trump said he will immediately take action to tighten US immigration restrictions once he's sworn in. "This country we're going to go very strong borders. From the day I get in. One of the first orders I'm going to sign. Day one." Trump reiterated plans to implement what he calls "extreme vetting" of people from the Muslim world, according to a Bild transcript translated into English by CNN. "There will be extreme security vetting, it won't be like it is now. We don't have any proper security controls for people entering our country, they don't really exist at the moment, like it has been the case in your country at least in the past." When asked if he would "That could happen. But we will see," he said. Trump also touched on the Iran nuclear agreement but declined to say whether he would demand changes to it. "Well I don't want to say what I'm gonna do with the Iran deal. I just don't want to play the cards. I mean, look, I'm not a politician, I don't go out and say, "I'm gonna do this" - I'm gonna do, I gotta do what I gotta do . . . But I'm not happy with the Iran deal, I think it's one of the worst deals ever made," he said, according to the Times. Trump Republican members of Congress have sharply criticized the deal since it was announced in 2014. Trump said he doesn't intend to lay off Twitter once he's in the Oval Office and will keep his @realDonaldTrump account, according to the Times of London. "I thought I'd do less of it, but I'm covered so dishonestly by the press - so dishonestly - that I can put out Twitter - and it's not 140, it's now 280 - I can go bing bing bing . . . and they put it on and as soon as I tweet it out - this morning on television, Fox - 'Donald Trump, we have breaking news.'"

Of the current list of 21 nominees, 14 must still sit for Senate hearings, and only five of those 14 have finalized their required paperwork. All nominees for Senate-confirmed positions must first work with the Office of Government Ethics to devise a plan for resolving any financial conflicts of interest before they start their new jobs. Typically, the ethics office But the paperwork for two of President-elect Donald Trump's billionaire nominees with hearings scheduled for this week -- namely, Education Secretary-designate Betsy DeVos (up Tuesday) and Commerce Secretary-designate Wilbur Ross (up Wednesday) -- were notably missing from the ethics office's website as of Monday afternoon. DeVos is an heir to the Amway fortune and Ross is an investor who made his money buying up distressed companies. A Senate source indicated that DeVos' initial hearing date had to be rescheduled because her paperwork "was nowhere near ready," and Ross had been sluggish in completing his financial disclosure report. The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a CNN request for comment. The nominees' missing paperwork comes at a particularly prickly time for relations between ethics office and the incoming administration. The trouble started after the election last November when Office of Government Ethics Director Walter Shaub "Announcing Cabinet picks without taking OGE up on the offer to take an early look at financial disclosure picks poses the risk of embarrassment for the President-elect ... in the event that the individual walks away from the nomination after learning what he or she will have to do with his or her financial interests," Shaub wrote. Nevertheless, Senate committees began scheduling hearings for several nominees while the ethics office grew concerned they were not being properly vetted ahead of time. "The announced hearing schedule for several nominees who have not completed the ethics review process is of great concern to me," Shaub wrote in a letter to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren earlier this month. "This schedule has created undue pressure on OGE's staff and agency ethics officials to rush through these important reviews. ...In fact, OGE has not received even initial draft disclosure reports for some of the nominees scheduled for hearings," he wrote. The Trump transition team Yet Shaub did not back down. He blasted Trump's proposed plan for separating from his business empire -- calling it " Shaub's comments did not sit well with "The head of the government ethics ought to be careful because that person is becoming extremely political," incoming White House chief of staff Reince Priebus said Sunday on ABC News' "This Week." Shaub's office has not responded to CNN interview requests, but if his letter earlier this month is any indication, he plans to stay the course despite the political consequences. "For as long as I remain director, OGE's staff and agency officials will not succumb to pressure to cut corners and ignore conflicts of interest," Shaub wrote.

However, even though times have changed, many presidents have revisited the same topics. Here's a look at how modern presidents have addressed the nation: On a day laden with tradition, it's no wonder that the founders of those traditions are name-dropped in inaugural addresses. It also helps that the inauguration ceremony overlooks monuments for founding fathers and former Presidents George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. For example, President As for the founding documents, it's no wonder the Constitution is so often a supporting character in the speech. It's the whole reason everyone is gathering for the inauguration in the first place. Even George Washington mentioned the newly minted Constitution in his On what is largely a day of celebration, many new presidents make sure not to gloss over the immense challenges the country is always facing. Being president isn't easy -- even during the country's best, most prosperous days, there are challenges. Since the inaugural address stands in for that year's State of the Union address, it's important for the president to communicate an understanding of the issues and to propose some kind of solution for them. When President Abraham Lincoln delivered his One problem that persists, regardless of the president or party in charge, is poverty. Many presidents take a moment to speak to some of their most disenfranchised constituents. President Franklin Roosevelt spoke directly to the millions of Americans impacted by the Great Depression during his Foreign policy has played a bigger role in inaugural addresses since the world wars, and with people around the world watching the inauguration, new presidents have taken the opportunity to use the platform to speak to America's friends as well as its enemies. In 1985, during the Cold War, President Ronald Reagan made sure to And in 1961, You can't give a good inauguration speech without celebrating America.

Let's look at President Barack Obama's ©Inauguration Day, even in the age of Donald Trump, is still pretty predictable, thanks to a city known for tradition and pomp and circumstance. Here's a rundown and a bit of history of all the people, places and things that will be a part of the action on January 20. Every president-elect since Jimmy Carter has stayed at Blair House, the guest home that sits across the street from the White House. And while there was some question about whether or not Donald Trump would stay there or at his hotel closer to the Capitol, the official word is that he's Blair House, Traditionally, Presidents-elect will leave Blair House to attend church the morning of Inauguration Day at St. John's, which sits on the other side of Lafayette Park. Despite its status as an Episcopal parish, presidents of multiple religious denominations have worshipped at St. John's. The church has even set aside a special pew -- No. 54 -- for the President and his guests. This part of the day takes place at the US Capitol. Perhaps you've heard of it. The President Thomas Jefferson According to the After being sworn in, the new President delivers an inaugural address. The Sitting in the cold and watching the entire inaugural ceremony is one way to work up an appetite. Luckily, the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies has the President-elect covered with a fancy luncheon inside the Capitol following the ceremony. The luncheon has occurred at the Capitol Up until 1953, there was no set tradition for the lunch. According to the committee, from the mid-1800s until the early 1900s, the new President would go from the Capitol to the White House to have lunch before the inaugural parade. In 1945, Roosevelt hosted upwards of 2,000 guests at the White House for his lunch, but those big soirees pushed back the start time of the parade on what was already a long day. So they officially moved it to the Capitol. The menus often reflect the home state of the President and vice president. JFK and LBJ After a big lunch, the best thing to do is get some steps in. Before the new President leads the country, he and the vice president lead the inaugural parade. Afterward, they watch the rest of the festivities from a bullet-proof viewing stand built in front of the White House. The parade The first organized parade was held for Madison in 1809. Harrison was the first parade to include floats, and President Abraham Lincoln's second inaugural parade in 1865 was the first to welcome African-Americans. In 1873, President Ulysses Grant started the tradition of viewing the parade at the White House after being sworn-in. The only time a parade has been canceled for bad winter weather was in 1985, but President Ronald Reagan had already had a parade four years earlier. This year's high temperature is projected to be in the high 50s, so Trump's parade should be safe. Notorious party animal Madison was the first to throw an inaugural ball -- at the very least he knew how to set the roof on fire. (That was a War of 1812 joke.) Tickets to that soiree were only $4. This year, Trump will have three official balls, including an event honoring military members and first responders. It was only in the 1950s that new presidents started It was only in the 1950s that new presidents started ©Those closest to her describe her as smart, independent-minded and relentless. Now, Ivanka Trump is poised to become one of the most influential -- and powerful -- first daughters in US history. Like few others in the incoming president's orbit, Trump has her father's ear and his trust. "She . . . has a great way of being able to, you know, talk to him," Ivanka's brother Don Jr. said in an interview with CNN's Gloria Borger. "He trusts her." Don Jr. and Eric Trump are among those speaking to Borger for a CNN Special Report, "First Daughter: Ivanka Trump," on Monday at 9 p.m. ET. Also appearing to talk all things Ivanka Trump are others close to her and the Trump family: incoming counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway; her close, longtime friend Maggie Cordish; and family friend and inauguration committee chairman Tom Barrack. Conway, who served as Donald Trump's campaign manager in the final months of the presidential campaign, described the father-daughter relationship as "impenetrable" and called Ivanka Trump a crucial voice during key campaign deliberations -- from urging him to act more presidential during the rough-and-tumble months of the campaign to helping him pick his running mate. "Ivanka Trump was in a very unique position to give her father voice in choosing a vice presidential running mate. Because she knows what Donald Trump expects," Conway said. That influence will now be put to work on behalf of the issues Trump advocated for during her father's presidential campaign: helping working mothers by Tom Barrack, a decadeslong friend of the billionaire real estate developer and next president, said Trump's influence comes down to her lack of ulterior motives. Trump has always had a "special voice" in her father's business and political life, Barrack said. "She has no skin in the game other than, 'I'm giving you my point of view because I love you Dad and I want you to be successful, and you need to listen to me,'" Barrack explained. Ivanka Trump said in a July interview with CNN that she is "incredibly candid with my opinions" Trump has yet to settle on a formal White House role, but her husband, Jared Kushner, will be one of the three most powerful aides in the West Wing. Trump officially announced Kushner would Kushner is poised to wield heavy-handed influence in the White House, just as he did during the campaign, where he was integral to crafting much of the campaign's strategy and to key hiring and firing decisions. Like his wife, Kushner knows "how to speak to my father," Don Jr. said. Beyond their marriage, much of Kushner's influence is tied to the working synergy he enjoys with his wife. "They really create a force to be reckoned with," Eric Trump said in an interview at Trump Tower last week with Borger. "They're very pragmatic thinkers. They spend a lot of time thinking, strategizing -- you know, planning. They really spend a lot of time in high level thought. And you know, they really feed off each other. Their personalities truly, truly feed off of each other." Kushner and Ivanka Trump first cut their teeth in their fathers' separate real estate empires in the New York area for years before the 2016 presidential run that pulled the whole family into politics. Trump is resigning her positions at the Trump Organization and management of her own eponymous brands to move to Washington -- moves aimed at quelling concerns about conflicts of interest tied to her husband and father's role, but that could also lay the foundation for her to join the White House in a more official capacity. For now, the mother of three said she plans to help her children settle into their new lives in the nation's capital. Cordish, a close friend of more than 20 years, called Trump a "fierce and devoted" mother who has worked hard to balance her ambitious career with her role as a mother. "She is up with them early every single morning, giving them breakfast and being with them. And then, you know, putting them to bed," Cordish said. But Trump does not need a formal White House position to keep hold of her influence once her father is inaugurated. What Trump values most in his daughter, Eric Trump said, comes down to one word: "Loyalty." "For years we'd always heard, you know, real estate's one of the most cutthroat industries in the world, right? It's very tough. It's very brash," the younger brother said. "Nothing compared to politics." "For years we'd always heard, you know, real estate's one of the most cutthroat industries in the world, right? It's very tough.

Kerry told CNN's Christiane Amanpour it was "inappropriate" for Trump to "be stepping in to the politics of other countries in a quite direct manner." As well as repeating his criticism of NATO, Trump said the German Chancellor Angela Merkel had made a "catastrophic" mistake in accepting one million refugees. He also said sanctions on Russia for its annexation of Crimea could be eased in return for a deal to reduce nuclear weapons, and suggested his son-in-law Jared Kushner could lead a Middle East peace effort. In his CNN interview, Kerry defended Merkel as "one of the strongest leaders in Europe" and "most important players with respect to where we are heading." Trump would have to deal with the consequences of his remarks after his inauguration later this week, Kerry said. "He'll have to speak to that -- as of Friday, he's responsible for that relationship," Kerry told CNN. Merkel shrugged off the criticism on Monday. "We have known what his position is for some time, and my position is also known," she told reporters in Berlin. But her foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, suggested NATO was rattled by Trump's comments. Steinmeier said he had spoken with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, "who is concerned that President-elect Trump regards NATO as obsolete." He noted Trump's position was "in contradiction" to that of Gen. James Mattis, Trump's nominee for defense secretary. Trump used the interview to suggest a new deal with Russia, saying sanctions imposed on Russia after it seized Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 could be eased in return for a nuclear weapons deal. He also heaped praise on Kushner, saying he could play a peacemaker role in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. "Do you know what? Jared is such a good guy; he will conclude an Israel agreement that no one else can do. You know, he is a natural talent, he is amazing, he is a natural talent," Trump said, according to Bild. "Do you know what? Jared is such a good guy; he will conclude an Israel agreement that no one else can do. You know, he is a natural talent, he is amazing, he is a natural talent," Trump said, according to Bild. ©Rep. John Lewis told the moving story of his life Monday at an event honoring Dr. Martin Luther King Jr -- and let the tale of forgiveness overcoming hatred stand as his response to attacks against him from President-elect Donald Trump. Speaking at a breakfast on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, the congressman said he was throwing out his prepared remarks and he never mentioned Trump by name after the President-elect had blasted him over the weekend as a man of talk and not action. Lewis described a life of action over decades in his address. Growing up poor as a sharecropper's son, Lewis said his involvement in civil rights activism began when he was 17 years old, continued throughout his life and came to define his career. Lewis talked about the sit-ins and marches in which he participated and the times he was arrested protesting racism and discrimination, as well as the brutal assaults he endured. He described an incident where he was beaten bloody by members of the Ku Klux Klan after attempting to enter a "white waiting room." "Many years later, in February of '09, one of the men that had beaten us came to my Capitol Hill office -- he was in his 70's, with his son in his 40's -- and he said, 'Mr. Lewis, I am one of the people who beat you and your seat mate" on a bus, Lewis said, adding the man said he had been in the KKK. He said, 'I want to apologize. Will you accept my apology?" After accepting his apology and hugging the father and son, the three cried together, Lewis remembered. "It is the power in the way of peace, the way of love," Lewis said. "We must never, ever hate. The way of love is a better way." Lewis also recalled the freedom march from Selma to Montgomery in 1965, or Bloody Sunday, that turned violent on the Edmund Pettis Bridge when state troopers attacked the demonstrators. "I was hit in the head by a trooper with a night stick. The first one to be hit. Knocked down, my knees went from under me. I thought I saw death," Lewis said. Not once mentioning Trump, Lewis' stories in themselves stood in opposition to Trump's attacks on the civil rights icon on Twitter Saturday. "I don't see this President-elect as a legitimate president," "Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results. All talk, talk, talk - no action or results. Sad," Trump tweeted Saturday morning. Politicians on both sides of the aisle quickly came to the Georgia congressman's defense. "Ahead of #MLKday2017, let us remember that many have tried to silence @repjohnlewis over the years. All have failed," House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi tweeted on Saturday morning. "John Lewis and his "talk" have changed the world," Nebraska Republican Sen. Ben Sasse tweeted with a link to images from the Selma march. But Trump remained adamant in his criticism of Lewis, later tweeting: "Congressman John Lewis should finally focus on the burning and crime infested inner-cities of the U.S. I can use all the help I can get!" The back-and-forth continued Monday. "I think Congressman Lewis start this, with your own Chuck Todd, by saying that the election was illegitimate and that President-elect Trump was an illegitimate president," said Sean Spicer, a top Trump aide "To see somebody of John Lewis' stature, and iconic nature, who has worked to enfranchise people and getting people involved in our voting systems and getting and talking about the integrity of our voting system, to go out when the candidate of his choice doesn't win, and try to talk about the delegitimatization of the election is disappointing," Spicer added. But Rep. Jerry Nadler of New York backed Lewis' about the legitimacy of Trump's presidency on CNN's "New Day," arguing that "although legally elected," he is "not legitimate." "We're not questioning the legality, we are not saying he is not the president or can act as president. We are saying that the election had real problems brought on by the FBI," Nadler said. First lady Michelle Obama also tweeted in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and thanked Lewis. "Thinking of Dr. King and great leaders like @repjohnlewis who carry on his legacy. May their example be our call to action. -mo" Lewis is among a growing group of politicians who have said they will not attend inauguration this weekend. Lewis is among a growing group of politicians who have said they will not attend inauguration this weekend. ©In a series of interviews in March of 2014, Donald Trump singled out Russia as the United States' "biggest problem" and greatest geopolitical foe. Trump's comments more than two years ago, which came in the wake of Russian incursions into Crimea, offer a sharp contrast to the Russia-friendly rhetoric he has employed since launching his presidential campaign. In the interviews reviewed by CNN's KFile from March 2014, which occurred on NBC News and Fox News, Trump goes as far as to suggest imposing sanctions to hurt Russia economically and then later says he supports such sanctions. Trump also expressed his agreement with former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney's 2012 assessment that Russia is the United States' number one "geopolitical foe." "Well, Mitt was right, and he was also right when he mentioned in one of the debates about Russia, and he said, 'Russia's our biggest problem, and Russia is, you know, really something,'" Trump "He said it's a hell of a problem, and everybody laughed at him, including certain media, by the way," continued Trump. "They laughed. It turned out that he's absolutely right. You look at what Russia's doing with Iran, how they controlled the situation, and Syria, and virtually every other place that ... We were thrown out of every place. I'm not saying we should be there. We should rebuild our own schools and our own bridges and highways and everything else. To be scoffed at and thrown around the way we're being thrown around is absolutely unthinkable." In an interview a few weeks earlier, on the March 3 "Well Mitt Romney was so right and nobody knew how right he was going to be and you look at Obama's response and just take a look at what's going on," said Trump. "Syria was propped up by Russia. Syria's now back in their fold 100% and that whole deal is coming to an end because Russia's taken over." Trump added the U.S. could use economic measures to harm Russia. "There are a lot of things we could be doing economically to Russia. Russia is not strong economically and we could do a lot of different things to really do numbers on them if we wanted to," said Trump. Trump went further speaking with "We should definitely do sanctions," Trump said while promoting the Miss USA pageant. "And we have to show some strength. I mean, Putin has eaten Obama's lunch, therefore our lunch, for a long period of time," he said. "And I just hope that Obama, who's not looking too good, doesn't do something very foolish and very stupid to show his manhood. I just hope that doesn't happen." A Trump transition spokesperson declined to comment for this story. Speaking with the Times of London and German newspaper Bild in an interview published on Sunday evening, the president-elect suggested sanctions that followed Russia's annexation of Crimea could be erased as part of deal for nuclear arms reduction. Trump also again singled out NATO, calling the alliance "obsolete." On Monday, that position was backed by a Russian government spokesman. Here's the March 24 interview: Here's the March 24 interview: ©What's next when you have helped snap the two longest championship droughts in sports history and, at 43, have all but clinched a place in baseball's Hall of Fame? If you are Theo Epstein of the World Series champion Chicago Cubs, the answer is at some point you could own a baseball franchise and not just run one. "I think you can do things as an owner that you can't necessarily do as an employee, helping the team really get involved in the community and doing some great work, using baseball as a vehicle to do some important work in society," Epstein, the Cubs' president of baseball operations and former Boston Red Sox general manager, told David Axelrod on "The Axe Files" podcast, produced by CNN and the University of Chicago Institute of Politics. Epstein, along with his twin brother Paul, started the Foundation To Be Named Later in 2005. According to its website, the foundation has granted $8.5 million to over 200 non-profit agencies benefiting urban youth and families. "The reality is these days so much of the most important work in society is done by these non-profits, most of which don't get real government funding, so it's really important to identify the most impactful non-profits in your community, especially in a city like Chicago right now that is battling so many critical challenges and support them," Epstein said. "Baseball is just bread and circus. What we do, we just entertain the masses." "Of course, at certain moments it becomes really meaningful to people and transcends that, but by large it's just bread and circus," he added. "But there are rich fans who are willing to spend money to get access to games and sit in better seats or sit in the general manager's box or get autographs or have these experiences going to dinner with players or with general managers. If you can use that and raise some money and redirect it to non-profits, I think that's a great thing and really our responsibility in some ways." For now, Epstein is focused on adding more titles with the young and talented Cubs, with whom he recently signed a five-year contract extension, and on Monday the team is visiting the White House, an annual tradition for title-winning teams. While Epstein and team chairman Tom Ricketts may share a common goal with the Cubs, the two have opposing political views, with Epstein a Democrat and Ricketts -- along with his father Joe and brothers Pete and Todd -- supporters of President-elect Donald Trump. However, Epstein says that divide has never affected their relationship. "Baseball gives us a lot to talk about besides politics, which is great, but I've never been one who feels that if you disagree with someone about politics, you can't connect with them in other ways or be friends with them or work constructively with them." At one point during the 2012 campaign, Epstein approached Tom Ricketts about doing an event for President Barack Obama to "balance" out the Ricketts' support for GOP nominee Mitt Romney. "I said, 'I feel like I need to do an event for Obama,' and [Ricketts] was fine with that," Epstein recalled. "He said, 'Yeah, that's totally fair.'" "You don't have to agree about politics all the time to agree about baseball and the Cubs."

Tom Price last year purchased shares in a medical device manufacturer days before introducing legislation that would have directly benefited the company, raising new ethics concerns for President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for Health and Human Services secretary. Price bought between $1,001 to $15,000 worth of shares last March in Zimmer Biomet, according to House records reviewed by CNN. Less than a week after the transaction, the Georgia Republican congressman introduced the HIP Act, legislation that would have delayed until 2018 a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) regulation that industry analysts warned would significantly hurt Zimmer Biomet financially once fully implemented. Zimmer Biomet, one of the world's leading manufacturers of knee and hip implants, was one of two companies that would have been hit the hardest by the new CMS regulation that directly impacts the payments for such procedures, according to press reports and congressional sources. After Price offered his bill to provide Zimmer Biomet and other companies relief from the CMS regulation, the company's political action committee donated to the congressman's reelection campaign, records show. If confirmed, Price will be a key player in Trump's efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Trump last week said a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare will be submitted "as soon as" Price is confirmed. He will appear before the Senate Health Committee this week, but must also appear before the Senate Finance Committee. The new revelation is the latest example of Price trading stock in a healthcare firm at the same time as pursuing legislation that could impact a company's share price. The issue has become a major liability for the congressman after The Wall Street Journal reported last month that he traded roughly $300,000 in shares over the past four years in health companies while pursuing legislation that could impact them. The purchase of the Zimmer Biomet shares is the latest such example, raising new concerns among ethics experts that Price may have inappropriately used inside information while purchasing shares in a company. Concerns over insider trading on Capitol Hill -- where members of Congress allegedly traded stock based on intelligence gleaned from the legislative process -- prompted the enactment of the STOCK Act in 2012 aimed at combating the practice. "It clearly has the appearance of using your influence as a congressman to your financial benefit," Larry Noble, general counsel at the Campaign Legal Center, a watchdog group, said of Price's transaction. "If he believed in the bill, he should not have purchased the stock." Phil Blando, a Price spokesman, did not initially respond directly to questions about the HHS nominee's purchase of Zimmer Biomet shares, instead pointing to a broader review of Price's holdings completed by the US Office of Government Ethics last week. "Dr. Price takes his obligation to uphold the public trust very seriously," Blando said. "The Office of Government Ethics has completed an exhaustive review of Dr. Price's financial holdings and just as Dr. Price was compliant with congressional disclosure rules, Dr. Price will comply fully with the recommendations put forward by the ethics office." After CNN's report published, Blando said: "Any effort to connect the introduction of Dr. Price's legislation, co-sponsored with Democrats, to a campaign contribution is demonstrably false. Dr. Price is fully complying with the recommendations put forth by the Office of Government Ethics." Zimmer Biomet is included in a broker-directed account and that the stock was purchased without his knowledge, a Price aide said after the story published. But CNN asked Price's office before the story published if there was a broker involved in the transaction, and a representative for the congressman declined to say. A Price aide claimed the congressman learned about the stock purchase on April 4, 2016 -- a few weeks after the source said the financial adviser made the transaction. Price continued to hold about $2,000 worth of shares in the company, the source said, despite having introduced the bill that would have helped the firm just days earlier. A spokesperson for Zimmer Biomet did not respond to an inquiry seeking comment. To avoid the appearance of conflicts-of-interest, Price announced last week that he would divest from 43 companies -- including Zimmer Biomet -- within 90 days of Senate confirmation. He said he will "not participate personally and substantially in any particular matter" on an issue that could affect any of those companies if he has not yet fully divested from them. But as a congressman, Price did not appear to adhere to such strict limits, including with Zimmer Biomet. As one of the prominent GOP voices on health care, Price sat on an influential Ways and Means subcommittee that directly oversees health care policy. And over the past year-and-a-half, Price raised objections to the CMS regulation that proposed major changes to how providers and manufacturers are paid and reimbursed for hip and knee implants through Medicare. But medical device manufacturers, in particular, were poised to be hit the hardest by the new regulation, according to industry officials and congressional sources. And that posed a significant threat to Zimmer Biomet, which bills itself as a worldwide leader in hip and knee replacements. In September 2015, Price spearheaded a letter to Andy Slavitt, the acting administrator of CMS, asking that the regulation be delayed because it "represents a significant change to our healthcare delivery system which could have a negative impact on patient choice, access and quality." Two days after the letter, Zimmer Biomet's PAC cut Price's reelection committee a check worth $1,000, according to campaign finance filings. When CMS didn't listen to Price, the congressman unveiled his legislation to delay implementing the regulation until 2018, with the bill coming days after investing in the company, whose shares were worth $103.59 at the time. Three months after he introduced the bill, the company's PAC cut Price's campaign committee another $1,000 check, according to records. Noble, the ethics law expert, said Price's motivations may have been pure, but the timing of the stock purchase raises eyebrows. "When you join the government, you are held to a higher standard," Noble said. "And you are supposed to work for the public and not for yourself." Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, responding to the CNN story, called for an ethics investigation into Price. "This new report makes clear that this isn't just a couple of questionable trades, but rather a clear and troubling pattern of congressman Price trading stock and using his office to benefit the companies in which he is investing," Schumer said in a statement. "The Office of Congressional Ethics needs to conduct an immediate and thorough investigation into these potential violations of the STOCK Act before Rep. Price's nomination moves forward."

But he may not want to talk about that much when he testifies before Congress this week as President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for Health and Human Services secretary. Price, a Georgia congressman and orthopedic surgeon, does not want the sole focus of his appearance before the Senate Health Committee on Wednesday to be his own proposal to repeal and replace Obamacare, according to a Trump transition official. He wants to avoid signaling that he is asking fellow lawmakers to endorse his plan to reform the country's health care system. In the lead-up to his confirmation hearings, Price has been kept out of the Trump transition team's efforts to craft an Obamacare replacement plan. According to a senior transition official, the incoming administration wants Price to be inoculated from questions about what Trump's alternative to the Affordable Care Act looks like when he faces probing senators this week. To this end, Price is preparing to emphasize his readiness to shift from a policymaker to a Cabinet official overseeing and implementing policy, and plans to discuss his qualifications that are separate from his work on Obamacare replacement legislation. "He's been in a policy-making role in Congress for the last 12 years but that mindset is definitely going to shift as he moves over," the official said. The suggestion that Price does not want to lobby for his own Obamacare legislation is significant. Trump, whose most urgent legislative priority as president is to overhaul President Barack Obama's signature health care law, said over the weekend that his own plan is almost complete and that he will unveil it as soon as Price is confirmed. The Price hearing comes as Republican lawmakers are also busy crafting a replacement blueprint, although a consensus alternative to the current health care system has yet to emerge. Price is also preparing to confront a slew of questions about potential conflicts of interest and his past financial investments. He has been criticized for investing in health companies while pursuing legislation that could influence those very firms. CNN reported Monday As Price prepares for potentially contentious hearings, a transition official emphasized that the team is not taking anything for granted ahead of his confirmation. Price must also testify before the Senate Finance Committee, which has not yet set a hearing date and will vote on his nomination. "It's all about the confirmation. Nobody's looking past that date," the transition official said. "It's all about the confirmation. Nobody's looking past that date," the transition official said. ©President-elect Donald Trump now says he wants "insurance for everybody" when Obamacare is replaced, which caused nearly every pundit in Washington and beyond scrambling to figure out what exactly he means. Will everyone get health care? Or will everyone get access to health care? Does that mean it'll be affordable to everyone? Can he get the Republican Congress unified behind that plan? ©President-elect Donald Trump's says he thinks NATO is "obsolete," but that view stands in stark contrast to his own picks for Defense Secretary and Secretary of State. Both Ret. Gen. James Mattis and former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson provided robust support for the alliance during their respective Senate confirmation hearings. "If we did not have NATO today, we would need to create it," Mattis said Thursday, adding that it "is vital to our national interests, and it's vital to the security of the United States." Trump's comments in an interview come days after The clear gulf between Trump's characterization of the alliance and that of his Cabinet nominees could set-up potential policy clashes with the White House. The diverging views were quickly noticed by officials in the US and Europe. "I have just had a conversation with the NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, who is concerned that President-elect Trump regards NATO as obsolete," German foreign minister Frank Walter Steinmeier said Monday. "This is in contradiction with what the American defense secretary (nominee) said in his hearing in Washington just a few days ago," Steinmeier added. Ivo Daalder, a former ambassador to NATO during President Barack Obama's first term, highlighted the perceived discrepancy in a tweet. And Secretary of STate John Kerry noted some of the conflicting views, saying of Trump, "His administration is going to have to begin at some point to speak with one voice." In the interview with the Times of London and Bild, Trump said NATO was obsolete "because it was, you know, designed many, many years ago," and "because it wasn't taking care of terror." Trump also once again claimed credit for the creation of a new NATO post, assistant secretary-general for intelligence and security, referring to it in the interview as a "terror division." NATO officials NATO officials have long stressed that the alliance has already had a role in combating terrorism through its missions in the Mediterranean, flying aerial support against ISIS, Afghanistan and elsewhere. Mattis, a former Supreme Allied Commander for NATO's transformation command, acknowledged the alliance's role in fighting terrorism, citing its operation in Afghanistan dating back to 9/11. "The first time it went to war was when this town and New York City were attacked. It's the first time NATO went into combat," Mattis said. Trump also complained that the members of the alliance are not paying the recommended 2% of GDP on defense, saying that only five of NATO's 22 members were meeting that target. There are actually 28 members of the alliance. "So we're supposed to protect countries but a lot of these countries aren't paying what they're supposed to be paying, which I think is very unfair to the United States," Trump said. And while NATO officials, Mattis and others have also sought to boost defense spending within the Alliance, Trump's pick for secretary of state, Tillerson, told the Senate Wednesday that the NATO treaty's collective defense "commitment is inviolable and the US is going to stand behind that commitment." "I'm confident that the president-elect expects us to live up to our word to include NATO in Article V," Mattis said, referencing the collective defense clause in the NATO treaty. Tillerson added that he would not recommend tying America's willingness to commit to the defense of a NATO ally in an attempt to get countries to boost their defense spending, a link that Trump had drawn in past interviews. Trump on Friday acknowledged the difference between some of his views and those of his nominees, taking to twitter to write, "I want them to be themselves and express their own thoughts, not mine!" But Trump also sent mixed messages on the alliance, saying that despite his criticism, "NATO is very important to me," and asked if Europe could depend on an American security guarantee, said "Yeah, I feel very strongly toward Europe." During his confirmation hearing, Mattis said that he has made his views on NATO clear to the President-elect, saying, "I have had discussions with him on this issue. He has shown himself open, even to the point of asking more questions, going deeper into the issue about why I feel so strongly." During his confirmation hearing, Mattis said that he has made his views on NATO clear to the President-elect, saying, "I have had discussions with him on this issue. He has shown himself open, even to the point of asking more questions, going deeper into the issue about why I feel so strongly." ©The alt-right is having a falling out -- in some ways with their President-elect, but in perhaps even more instances with each other. And it comes on the eve of an alt-right inaugural celebration called the DeploraBall -- a play off of Hillary Clinton's "basket of deplorables" campaign remark. Look no further than the white nationalist who coined the term alt-right, Richard Spencer. He's the same man who stood at a podium shortly after Donald Trump's election and, in a video that went viral, shouted "Hail Trump!" while several in the crowd celebrated the victory with a Nazi salute. But listen to him now, you'll notice a marked shift in tone when speaking of the man who will become the 45th President of the United States. "I have described it as the morning-after period. We got euphoric and a little drunk on success," Spencer, director of the white nationalist think tank National Policy Institute, told CNN. "I am getting worried that he won't work on really big important issues like immigration -- that he'll get caught up on little things like making fun of people on Twitter." Some others in the alt-right are starting to wonder if Trump is really their guy. They've become increasingly critical of his Cabinet picks, and the fact that he's admitted that Russia did in fact engage in hacking leading up to the election. Last month, Spencer even tweeted, "The #AltRight was aligned with the Trump cheerleaders for 2016. That period is over." But whether Spencer agrees with Trump or not, his "Hail Trump" speech has had a major impact on the alt-right. Since video of it emerged, there's been a split of alt-righters who believe the neo-Nazi rhetoric has hurt their own cause. So now, they're feuding among themselves -- some of them distancing themselves from the alt-right label, although many of the extreme nationalist views remain. "There is a major division going on," Spencer said. "I feel like there's this overreaction to Hail-gate, as we're calling it. Some people overreacted and allowed the mainstream media to set the rules for the game." Spencer is a white nationalist who believes that there should be a "peaceful ethnic cleansing," where people who are not of European descent voluntarily leave the United States. He says he briefly entertained a run for the US House seat from Montana expected to be open when Rep. Ryan Zinke is confirmed as Trump's interior secretary. Spencer said he decided against it, although that doesn't mean he has any intention of sitting things out. He said he is planning to purchase a house in Washington, where he plans to hold events and create a video production studio. "The alt-right has become about white identity politics," said Mike Cernovich, who drew ire from alt-righters on social media after he told them they were not welcome at his DeploraBall on the eve of Trump's inauguration in Washington. "Obviously I'm not a white-identitarian, so the alt-right can do their thing. I'm a nationalist and populist. I care about national sovereignty of America." Cernovich told CNN that he rescinded an invitation to an alt-right social media personality known by many names, one being Tim Treadstone, who originally was a co-planner of the DeploraBall after Treadstone posted anti-Semitic Twitter posts. "We aren't going to tolerate incendiary acts to disrupt this event," said Jeff Giesea, who is helping to organize the DeploraBall. "We can't control everything or everybody. If that happens we will make clear that's not what we're about. That's not welcome." Treadstone did not respond to CNN's request for comment. But still on the invite list is Milo Yiannopolous, a known extremist who wrote for Breitbart news and is a notorious internet troll. He was banned from Twitter in July after targeting Ghostbusters and SNL actress Leslie Jones with racist and abusive tweets. Another name on the event's posters is Alex Jones of InfoWars, a man famous for peddling far-right conspiracy theories like the one calling the Sandy Hook school shooting a hoax. And Jack Posobiec, another of the DeploraBall's organizers, has been accused of creating a "Rape Melania" sign in order to create bad publicity for anti-Trump protesters. Posobiec did not respond to CNN's request for an interview. Then, when negotiations fell through for the original event space organizers had in mind, the venue, the Clarendon Ballroom, says it began getting threatening calls from Trump supporters. The event will now be held at the National Press Club. Keep in mind, the alt-right is a relatively small group of people who mostly congregate on Twitter and the dark web. But in the past two years, they've become more public, and are pushing their way into the mainstream. Cernovich says 1,000 DeploraBall tickets sold out in about 24 hours. But the alt-right has always been a fractured movement, made up of differing racist views. Some are clearly anti-Semitic, while others are accepting of Jews. Almost all of them are pro-radical immigration reform. This latest divide seems to be fueled somewhat by optics. Some members trying to appear less extreme have denounced the neo-Nazi symbolism as they try to court college students and disenfranchised Americans. It isn't just Spencer who's disillusioned with the incoming President. Other white supremacists told CNN they're frustrated -- they believed Trump would align more closely with their white nationalist and racist views. Their comments are, at times, very alarming, and too incendiary to print. While there seems to be uniform support for Trump's pick for attorney general, Jeff Sessions, a man accused of making racist comments against African Americans -- noted Klansman and white nationalist David Duke praised the choice -- the rest of his Cabinet nominees are not as popular to this group. Sessions has denied making racist comments and denounced the KKK at a Senate hearing last week. " White supremacists have taken issue with fast-food CEO Andrew Puzder, tapped for labor secretary, South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley, picked to be the US ambassador to the United Nations, and Goldman Sachs executive Gary Cohn, Trump's pick for top economic adviser. A recent episode of The Daily Shoah, a neo-Nazi podcast on an extremist online radio station called The Right Stuff, guests discussed their anger at Trump, lamenting, "Trump is not ideologically on board with us." Another person chimed in, "this goes into 'he lied to us territory.' " Yet another said, "All the picks have been bad." Andrew Anglin, the founder of the neo-Nazi Daily Stormer website, said "an end to the hostility with Russia is something we did expect." He said, "whites need to ally together against their enemies, and a big part of the reason we elected Trump is to form a good relationship with Russia." Anglin told CNN that he is sending representatives on his behalf to DC for the purpose of protesting DeploraBall organizer Mike Cernovich after Cernovich allegedly exposed the head of neo-nazi site "The Right Stuff" for having a secret Jewish wife. Anglin also said his people also plan to protest Milo Yiannopoulos, demanding that he be "deported to Israel." Yiannopoulos is Jewish but has spoken disparagingly about Jews. Jared Taylor, a self-described white nationalist who campaigned for Trump, said it was foolish for members of the alt-right to believe that Trump would actually appoint white nationalists to his Cabinet. "If they ever thought that Donald Trump was a racially conscious advocate for white people, they were wrong," Taylor said. "I never thought that, but I certainly considered him to be a vastly superior alternative. ... He was never a candidate in line with my views. Donald Trump is an American nationalist, but he doesn't think in racial terms. Donald Trump has some instinctive sense that we can't just let anyone in here." It's not shocking that the alt-right isn't all on the same page. Even before they rose to national prominence and began to speak more publicly -- more than just the dark corners of the web -- they were a fractured movement, riddled with feuds and disagreements. Taylor, once a mentor to Spencer before a falling out, admitted that. "Every movement does better when the people in that movement have a firm grasp of reality," he said. "So to the extent that people might be disappointed with Donald Trump, if it gives them a clearer view, then they'll have to be disappointed."

John Lewis is again at the front lines of a pitched battle over America's future. The congressman from Georgia is The long-serving Democrat was a young activist and leader of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee when, in March 1965, he joined forces with Martin Luther King Jr. to lead a voting rights march out out Selma, Alabama. But as the nonviolent demonstrators approached the Edmund Pettus Bridge, on their way to the state capital in Montgomery, they were confronted by heavily armed state troopers and local police. When the march refused to turn back, protesters were set upon and beaten. The images from "Bloody Sunday" -- and Lewis, who was photographed under assault and suffered a fractured skull -- helped galvanize support for the Voting Rights Act, which was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson months later, on August 6. In a series of tweets on Monday, as Americans observe a federal holiday in honor of King, Lewis recalled the man he often describes as a "Dr. King taught us to recognize the dignity and worth of every human being. He was the moral compass of our nation," he tweeted. King "marched for us," "protested for us," "went to jail for us," and ultimately "gave his life for us," Lewis wrote. Born in Troy, Alabama, on February 21, 1940, Lewis attended segregated schools and began organizing in his teens, helping coordinate student sit-in demonstrations in Nashville in 1959 and 1960. By 1963, he was the chairman of SNCC, a post he would hold through a dangerous era that saw civil rights leaders targeted and assassinated, but also the passage of the Civil Rights Act. In August 1963, the 23-year-old delivered a keynote address at the March on Washington. After being appointed to lead the federal volunteer agency, ACTION, by President Jimmy Carter in 1977, Lewis was elected to the Atlanta City Council in 1981. Five years later, he won his first congressional race. He has served now for decades as the US representative from the Georgia's Fifth District.

Power's remarks, at the Washington-based Atlantic Council, are just the latest warning by outgoing Obama administration officials of the need to be wary of Russian intentions as Trump repeatedly asserts his desire for better ties with Moscow, sometimes criticizing US intelligence services in the process. Power made indirect reference to Trump, who denigrated US intelligence agencies after their conclusion that Russia had hacked the US election in an attempt to undermine Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. "What is not healthy is for a party or its leaders to cast doubt on a unanimous, well-documented assessment of our intelligence community that a foreign government is seeking to harm our country," Power said. The UN Ambassador described Russia as "a major threat facing our nation" and, in the clearest attempt yet by the outgoing administration to draw a line on Moscow, she systematically laid out a case for US cooperation with Russia where possible, but with the understanding that an outright embrace runs counter to American interests and global stability. Citing Russia's invasion of Crimea, its interventions in Syria and Ukraine, as well as its interference in European democracies and elections, Power warned that "our values, our security, our prosperity, and our very way of life are tied" to a rules-based international order that Russia, under President Vladimir Putin, is working to weaken. Asserting that Putin has had journalists, activists and members of the opposition "murdered," Power went on to say the "United States and its closest partners must come together to prevent Russia from succeeding." "Russia's actions are not standing up a new world order," Power said, "they are tearing down the one that exists. This is what we are fighting against -- having defeated the forces of fascism and communism, we now confront the forces of authoritarianism and nihilism." Power said there should be high-level contacts between the US and Russia, but cautioned that the relationship "can't be one that glosses over the past or papers over the fact that you have a leader who has his own opponents intimidated and in some cases killed." She warned against "allowing history to be erased" by forgetting or overlooking what Russia has done, and cautioned against easing sanctions on Russia -- a possibility Trump has floated. In what amounted to a call for continuity in US foreign policy, Power said that "easing punitive measures on the Russian Government when they haven't changed their behavior will only embolden Russia -- sending the message that the best way to gain international acceptance of its destabilizing actions is simply to wait us out." Not only would that spur more dangerous actions by Russia, Power said, it would embolden "other rule-breakers like Iran and North Korea, which are constantly testing how far they can move the line without triggering a response." Power's remarks come after John Brennan, the Director of National Intelligence, delivered a thinly veiled warning to the President-elect on FOX News this week. "I don't think he has a full appreciation of Russian capabilities, Russia's intentions, and actions they are undertaking in many parts of the world," Brennan said. "I think he has to be mindful that he does not yet, I think, have a full appreciation and understanding of what the implications are of going down that road, as well as making sure he understands what he's doing." Trump, who likened the intelligence community to Nazi Germany, has said often that he seeks a better relationship with Russia and praised Putin.

Obama issued his splashiest grants of clemency on Tuesday when he reduced the But he's not finished just yet. Already an avid user of his presidential clemency powers, Obama is expected to hand down additional grants on Thursday to non-violent drug offenders, who sentences he's been commuting at a rapid pace as he prepares to depart office. Last week, Obama announced he was ending a decades-long immigration policy that Prominent Cuban-American lawmakers, including Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, blasted the move. But administration officials said it was a natural extension of Obama's reopening of ties to Cuba, the future of which remains uncertain in a Trump administration. Just as he has for the past eight years, Obama is "Even if they are not confirmed for the position that they've been nominated for, there may be future opportunities in a similar area where they could continue to serve the United States," White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Tuesday. Ten former Earnest conceded Tuesday the goal would remain elusive. But he suggested the transfers wouldn't stop. "At this time, I don't anticipate that we will succeed in that goal of closing the prison, but it's not for a lack of trying, I assure you," Earnest said. "The possibility of additional transfers remains a possibility." As his term wraps up, Obama is considering a final policy shift forcing hundreds of school districts to cut spending at well-financed elementary and secondary schools and move nearly $1 billion dollars to schools with large numbers of low-income students. The policy, written by the Education Department, is under review by the White House budget office and has drawn fierce opposition from Republican lawmakers and school administrators. It was first proposed in September, but the department appears to have rushed to adopt it since Trump won the presidential election. Adopting the regulation before Friday at noon would bind the incoming Trump administration unless Congress overturns it. Making last-minute use of his conservation powers, Obama designated a set of landmarks in the American South as national monuments last week. The sites all mark the civil rights movement: A Birmingham hotel where Martin Luther King Jr. strategized, an Alabama monument to the Freedom Riders, and a South Carolina site that tells the story of reconstruction. Obama has used his unilateral powers under the Antiquities Act to preserve land and marine areas from around the Pacific island of Midway to undersea mountain ranges in the Atlantic. ©Donald Trump's pick for education secretary, Betsy DeVos, said at her confirmation hearing on Tuesday night that she would consider actions the President-elect described on a 2005 hot mic tape released during the 2016 campaign to be sexual assault. Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate committee considering DeVos' nomination, asked the Michigan Republican whether she would consider the actions described on the tape -- "kissing and touching women and girls without their consent," she said paraphrasing Trump -- to be sexual assault. "Yes," DeVos answered simply. The "Access Hollywood" tape rocked the race and led to days' worth of news coverage about Trump's comments. "When you're a star, they let you do it. You can do anything," Trump said on the tape, after describing how he would kiss and grope women without their consent. Trump responded to the video by apologizing "if anyone was offended." "This was locker-room banter, a private conversation that took place many years ago," he said. DeVos, should she be confirmed, would oversee the enforcement of campus sexual assault rules. During the hearing, she told Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pennsylvania, that she could not commit to continuing the Obama administration's guidance that schools that don't investigate campus sexual assault would be violating Title IX and could lose funding.

But the hearing largely hinged on her qualifications for the job. When Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota asked DeVos whether she believed growth or proficiency was a better way to judge group of students, the Michigan Republican stumbled to answer and asked for clarification. Franken pounced, suggesting that DeVos does not have the "breadth and depth of knowledge" to be education secretary. "It surprises me that you don't know this issue," Franken said, later adding, bitingly, that actually he was "not that surprised." DeVos has been a political heavyweight for decades, spending millions to advance conservative causes in her home state of Michigan and across the country. Much of her fortune had gone towards backing politicians and organizations that encourage voucher programs, allowing parents to send their children to private schools and helping them pay for it. "It's time to shift the debate from what the system thinks is best for kids to what moms and dads want, expect and deserve. Parents no longer believe that a one-size-fits-all model of learning meets the needs of every child," DeVos said, adding that she will push for more access to charter, home and religious schools. DeVos said that she would be a "a strong advocate for great public schools," but would support "a parent's right to enroll their child in a high-quality alternative." During a question and answer with Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, DeVos declined to answer whether she believed in applying the same standards to pubic, charter and private schools. "I support accountability," DeVos said four times. When asked directly if she was declined to answer the question, DeVos simply said: "I support accountability." Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, forced DeVos to admit that she has never led an organization akin to the Education Department, and has never used any of the financial aid products she will offer to students as head of it. "So you have no experience with college financial aid or management of higher education," Warren said. DeVos was also pressed on civil rights laws dealing with students with disabilities, saying early in the hearing implementation should be left up to the states. Sen. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire circled back to DeVos near the end of the hearing, informing her the law was a federal statute. "Federal law must be followed when federal dollars are in play," DeVos said. "So were you unaware when I just asked you about the (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act) that it was a federal law?" Hassan asked. "I may have confused it," DeVos said. Democrats also keyed in on DeVos ties to education companies and possible accusations of conflict-of-interest between the potential education secretary and those she will seek to regulate. These concerns have been exacerbated by the fact that DeVos' ethics paperwork, a requirement for anyone seeking a Cabinet post, has not yet been cleared by the Office of Government Ethics. While the paperwork is not required to be approved before a hearing, as a Republican committee aide noted, it is required before the committee votes, meaning the delay in paperwork approval could delay DeVos' confirmation. "I am extremely disappointed that we are moving forward with this hearing before receiving the proper paperwork from the Office of Government Ethics," Sen. Patty Murray, the committee's top Democrat, said Tuesday. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer also expressed his frustration with Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Chairman Lamar Alexander said there would only be one round of senator questions. Schumer said she was controversial and Democrats need more than one five-minute period to ask her questions, adding that Alexander should schedule a second hearing and warned if he doesn't if could impact how Democrats deal with confirming other nominees. DeVos also did not commit to continuing the Obama administration's 2011 guidance on campus sexual assault, guidance that found schools would be in violation of Title IX and risk losing federal funds if they don't properly investigate sexual assault allegations. "It would be premature for me to do that today," DeVos said. DeVos, a mother of four, said the issue of campus sexual assault "is really piqued on this issue," but added that she would work to get read in on the issue once she gets to the Education Department. The Michigan Republican did affirm that the actions Trump described on a leaked "Access Hollywood" 2005 tape -- where he described kissing and groping women without their consent -- constitutes sexual assault. "Yes," DeVos said when asked by Murray about the tape that rocked the presidential campaign. The comment marks a break from Trump's talking points at the time, which was largely to dismiss the comments as "locker room talk." DeVos has been a prolific Republican donor for decades. She has given millions to groups that advocate for school privatization and voucher programs, including the American Federation for Children, a group she chaired from 2009 to 2016. Like several of Trump's Cabinet picks, DeVos has tremendous wealth. Forbes estimates DeVos and her husband, Dick, are worth upwards of $5 billion. She has also donated to at least four of the senators who heard her testimony on Tuesday. Responding to a question from Sen. Bernie Sanders, DeVos said "collectively (it) is possible" her family has given around $200 million to Republican causes over the years. DeVos' giving through a slew of family foundations was also an issue in regards to how she would handle LGBT issues as education secretary. Franken pushed DeVos regarding donations to Focus on the Family, an organization that believes conversion therapy for LGBT. Franken directly asked DeVos whether she "still believes" in conversion therapy. "I have never believed in that," DeVos said, adding, "I fully embrace equality." DeVos and her family -- through three family foundations -- have given more than $10 million to Focus on the Family, according to watchdog groups. DeVos later said that senators were conflating donations she made and those made her mother's foundation. "My mother makes the decisions for her foundation," she said. "My mother makes the decisions for her foundation," she said. ©Betsy DeVos, President-elect Donald Trump's education secretary nominee, said it should be up to states whether guns are allowed in schools, citing grizzly bear protection as part of her answer. She also said she would support Trump if he moved to ban gun-free schools zones, a position he advocated on the campaign trail. Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, who represents Sandy Hook, the site of the 2012 school shooting, asked DeVos if she believes guns have "any place in and around schools." "I think that is best left to locales and states to decide," she said. After Murphy pushed DeVos about why she can't say definitively whether they belong, DeVos brought up a story Sen. Mike Enzi told earlier about a school in Wyoming that has fences around it to protect against grizzly bears. "I will refer back to Sen. Enzi and the school he is talking about in Wyoming. I think probably there, I would imagine there is probably a gun in a school to protect from potential grizzlies," she said. The comment drew some laughs in the room. As for Trump's campaign pledge to end gun free school zones, DeVos said she would support the President-elect on the issue. "If the question is around gun violence and the results of that, please know that my heart bleeds and is broken for those families that have lost any individual due to gun violence," she said. Murphy, a gun control advocate, later tweeted: "Tonight #BetsyDeVos would not oppose putting guns in our schools. I was shaken to the core by her answer. So should every American parent."

"What she wants to do is actually just drain the public system of the dollars it desperately needs." President-elect Donald Trump's pick did not attend public school, and neither did any of her four kids, which is concerning to some of DeVos' critics. Weingarten, who supported Hillary Clinton in the presidential election, called her "the most anti-public education nominee who has ever been nominated for that position." Those "There is no precedent for an Education Department secretary nominee with your lack of experience in public education," wrote Warren, who also raised concerns about DeVos' "seemingly nonexistent record on higher education." However, DeVos' experience and abilities have made strong supporters out of others. "She is a leader, and we need transformational change," Eva Moskowitz told CNN's John Berman. Moskowitz is the founder and CEO of Success Academy Charter Schools, and previously served as a New York City Councilwoman. She also supported Hillary Clinton. Moskowitz argued that many schools are unsafe, and that DeVos can help. "I think she's going to shake things up," she said. "She's going to take her passion for schooling and parent choice and make a really significant difference for the country." But Weingarten said there are "lots of things we can do to make sure public schools are a viable choice." She has invited DeVos to visit the schools she is working in. "If you are going to use the public dollar, you better make sure the choice is a good choice for parents," she said. "If you are going to use the public dollar, you better make sure the choice is a good choice for parents," she said. ©Even as Donald Trump readies to take the oath of office on the west side of the Capitol, some of his top Cabinet picks are off to a rocky start this week inside the building, facing surprising heat. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer opened Inauguration Week Tuesday morning by saying that Trump's pick to oversee the dismantling of Obamacare, Tom Price, may have broken the law with a stock purchase last year and should be investigated. Meanwhile, questions have swirled about how prepared (and willing) Trump's picks for the Treasury and Labor departments are to face a barrage of criticism at their hearings. And another top Trump aide split after CNN uncovered examples of her plagiarizing multiple works. Tom Price, a former top Republican in the House and medical doctor is set for a hearings before a pair of Senate committees before he can take the helm at the Department of Health and Human Services. And those hearings promise to be painful after reports that Price may have tried to help companies that he bought stock in. "If he knew about it, it could very well be a violation of the law," It's a particularly auspicious time for the incoming Trump administration as it tries to find its footing on the chief issue absorbing all of Washington: replacing Obamacare. And Price is set to be at the forefront of that drive. Veteran television personality and conservative commentator Monica Crowley was never nominated to a Cabinet spot, but still drew plenty of attention for a high-profile appointment on Trump's national security team. And the heat swirled around Crowley after CNN's K-File investigative team stunned Washington with news that she had repeatedly plagiarized works, Trump's promise to bring outsiders into his Cabinet -- which has often resulted in billionaires taking on major roles -- has turned confirmation hearings in Capitol into a shooting gallery with Trump's top aides unable to dodge the fire, from Democrats and even some Republicans.

But that is effectively what he had to do to The move came with the hours fast running down on Obama's presidency and rocked the political, intelligence and military intelligence establishments in Washington. And it will now rest forever on the 44th President's legacy as one of the most controversial moments of his tenure, judging by the furious bipartisan reaction to his decision to free someone regarded by many in Washington as as a traitor. His decision to announce the commutation on the eve of his final presidential news conference on Wednesday indicates he wanted to explain the reasons for his decision to the American people in person. That opportunity may go some way to ensuring that the move does not sow controversy at the start of his post-presidency, as Bill Clinton's controversial pardon for fugitive financier Marc Rich did in 2001. Senior officials told CNN that Obama decided to act because Manning had expressed remorse and responsibility for her actions, and she had already served six years of a long sentence. Obama may also have been motivated by humanitarian considerations, given that Manning is a transgender woman facing decades in an all-male prison and has attempted suicide several times. He may also have reasoned that with President-elect Donald Trump about to take office, the chances of Manning winning release for years to come were slim. The President also came under intense pressure from LGBT groups that have been stalwart supporters throughout his political career to show eleventh hour compassion towards Manning. A source with knowledge of the White House's thinking told CNN's Gloria Borger that Obama's decision took into account the fact that Manning -- unlike fugitive leaker Edward Snowden -- had pleaded guilty in a court of law to her offenses. But in many ways, the decision appeared to run counter to some of Obama's own instincts as president and the sensitivity of the political moment. To begin with, Obama has cultivated a reputation as showing zero tolerance to leakers of classified secrets during his administration. "We're a nation of laws, we don't make our own individual decision about how the laws operate," Obama told protestors who heckled him over the US government's treatment of Manning at a fundraiser in 2011. Obama's disdain for WikiLeaks itself, which published hundreds of thousands of classified documents stolen by Manning, is well known even though it didn't prevent him, in the end, from showing mercy to Manning. The whistle-blowing website run by Julian Assange published hundreds of thousands of documents stolen by Manning, including battlefield logs from Iraq and Afghanistan and diplomatic cables that caused deep US embarrassment. Now, the organization is at the center of the storm over alleged Russian hacking of Democratic servers during the election, and Assange is being accused of directly subverting American democracy. Obama had sent his then secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, around the world to apologize to US allies for embarrassingly frank disclosures by US diplomats on cables from American embassies to Washington published on the site. Then Clinton herself, in the eyes of many Democrats, was deprived of the presidency because of the stolen emails from her campaign that were blasted around the world by WikiLeaks during the election. Military officials are likely to be especially angry about the move, given the fact that they argued the Wikileaks cables and disclosures endangered US service members, diplomats and those who cooperated with them in Iraq and Afghanistan. It did not take long for WikiLeaks to declare victory over the commutation -- something that could further Obama's public discomfort. "Victory," Wikileaks said in a series of tweets welcoming the move. Snowden, who is exiled in Russia and has also been linked to Wikileaks, also congratulated Manning, tweeting "Thanks, Obama." The political reaction to Manning's impending release from prison -- by May 17 -- was swift and critical. "Manning stabbed his fellow soldiers in the back by releasing classified information and putting their lives at risk," Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham told CNN's Dana Bash. "President Obama, by granting clemency to Manning, slapped all those who serve honorably in the face," Graham said. But Manning's supporters, who have spent years calling on Obama to grant clemency, arguing that her act was motivated by a desire to expose abuses by US troops on the battlefield. Manning's sentence was "grossly disproportionate, it was far longer than any any that had previously been imposed for offenses related to the leak of sensitive information," Maria McFarland Sanchez-Moreno, of the US division of Human Rights Watch, told CNN International. "The message that was sent by such a long sentence was that people who release classified information even if it is released in the pubic interest, even if it doesn't cause severe harm, will be prosecuted. That could have a chilling effect going forward on other whistleblowers who might have information about abuses, human rights violations, fraud, corruption to disclose." ©President The decision -- which a senior defense official told CNN was made over the objections of Secretary of Defense Ash Carter -- immediately touched off a controversy in the closing days of the Obama administration. A former intelligence official described being "shocked" to learn of Obama's decision, adding that the "entire intelligence community is deflated by this inexplicable use of executive power." The official said the move was "deeply hypocritical given Obama's denunciation of WikiLeaks' role in the hacking of the (Democratic National Committee)." The President also pardoned James Cartwright, the former vice chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, who pleaded guilty in October to a single charge of making false statements to federal investigators in 2012 when he was questioned about leaking top secret information on US efforts to cripple Iran's nuclear program to two journalists. A presidential commutation reduces the sentence being served but it does not change the fact of conviction, whereas a pardon forgives a certain criminal offense. Manning, a transgender woman, was serving a 35-year sentence at Fort Leavenworth, an all-male Army prison in eastern Kansas, despite her request to transfer to a civilian prison. A White House statement on Tuesday said her prison sentence is set to expire on May 17. The material, which WikiLeaks published in 2010, included a classified video of a US helicopter attacking civilians and journalists in Iraq in 2007. Labeled "Collateral Murder," the film drew criticism from human rights activists for the deaths of innocent people. Though found guilty on 20 out of 22 possible charges (including violating the US Espionage Act), Manning was not convicted of the most serious one; aiding the enemy, which could have earned the private a life sentence. Instead, the former intelligence analyst was sentenced to prison, as well as demoted from private first class to private and dishonorably discharged. Nancy Hollander, an attorney for Manning, told CNN the former soldier has been "nervous the last few days" as she waited for word in the closing days of the Obama administration. Hollander said she only learned of the commutation around the time Obama made the announcement. "She knows she's going to be free," Hollander said. "She can start her life." Asked to describe the difference between the situations of Manning and former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, who is living in exile in Russia after leaking state secrets, a source with knowledge of the White House's thinking said there was a "fundamental difference" between the two. Snowden, the source said, "dodged blame, fled the country and is hiding from prosecution," whereas Manning admitted guilt without a deal and eventually confessed. "She went through the process, acknowledged she had done something wrong. She was tried and sentenced," the source said. The White House is aware that the intelligence community and the Pentagon may be dismayed by the decision, but, the source added, this "doesn't set a precedent if you consider the distinction between the two of them to be material." Part of the thinking was that Manning's term was quite "extreme" and "without historical precedent" and she had already served more than six years, the source said, adding that another factor is the personal and emotional side of the Manning story: she is transgender, in a male prison, "facing an uncertain fate behind bars." Snowden President-elect Donald Trump did not immediately comment on the matter, but when asked about WikiLeaks in the wake of the releases in 2010, he told Fox News' Brian Kilmeade: "I think it's disgraceful. I think there should be like death penalty or something." Earlier this month, WikiLeaks said it would agree to a US extradition request for the site's founder, Julian Assange, if Obama granted clemency to Manning. It was not immediately clear if WikiLeaks would make good on its promise, though the group declared "victory" in a tweet Tuesday afternoon. A senior administration official insisted Tuesday that Obama's decision "was not influenced in any way by public comments by Mr. Assange or the WikiLeaks organization." Chase Strangio, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, which represented Manning, said he was "relieved and thankful" Obama commuted her sentence, and Amnesty International also cheered news of Manning's commutation. "Chelsea Manning exposed serious abuses, and as a result, her own human rights have been violated by the US government for years," Margaret Huang, the group's executive director, said in a statement. "President Obama was right to commute her sentence, but it is long overdue. It is unconscionable that she languished in prison for years while those allegedly implicated by the information she revealed still haven't been brought to justice." Republican members of Congress, however, expressed outrage. "This was grave harm to our national security. and Chelsea Manning is serving a sentence and should continue to serve that sentence," Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, told CNN's Jake Tapper on "The Lead." House Speaker Paul Ryan, denouncing Manning's "treachery," And South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham told CNN that Manning "stabbed his fellow soldiers in the back" and Obama "slapped all those who serve honorably in the face." Cartwright's career was marked by decades of distinguished military service. From August 2007 to August 2011, he served as the second-highest uniformed officer and, before that, he served as commander of US Strategic Command. During his tenure in these posts, he held the highest security clearance, and retained top security clearance upon his retirement from the military in 2011. The senior administration official said Cartwright's motive mattered in Obama's decision to pardon him, calling it "different than most people who leak info to journalists." "We are deeply grateful for President Obama's decision to pardon General Cartwright. ... Current and former leaders of the American national security community have, almost with one voice, stood up for General Cartwright. We thank them for supporting a man who is truly one of our nation's heroes," Cartwright's attorney and former White House counsel, Gregory Craig, said in a statement. Federal prosecutors had sought a two-year prison sentence for Cartwright in court filings earlier this month, but his attorneys asked for probation, emphasizing his desire to persuade journalists to modify their reporting to protect national security interests. "General Cartwright understands the magnitude of his offense and deeply regrets the decision that he made ... He has accepted responsibility and acknowledged his guilt," his attorneys wrote in court papers. "(I)n General Cartwright's communications with both journalists, he successfully persuaded them not to report information that would be harmful to the United States." One of those reporters, David Sanger of The New York Times, submitted a letter in support of Cartwright explaining that "throughout the interview, (Cartwright) consistently showed his concern that information damaging to US interests not be made public." The other reporter, Daniel Klaidman, who wrote for Newsweek, also submitted a letter on Cartwright's behalf, as did several current and former members of Congress, along with military officials from the Bush and Obama administrations, all urging the judge for leniency in light of Cartwright's decorated military career. Cartwright, 67, served 40 years in the US Marine Corps and was widely regarded within the military for his technical acumen and work in the areas of nuclear proliferation, missile defense and cybersecurity. He was scheduled for sentencing before DC District Court Judge Richard Leon on January 31. ©Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday that Donald Trump's pick to quarterback the replacement of Obamacare, Tom Price, may have broken the law with a questionable stock purchase. "If he knew about it, it could very well be a violation of the law," Schumer told CNN. "Now they say there's a broker, it's kind of strange that this broker would pick this stock totally independently of him introducing legislation that's so narrow and specific to this company." Schumer also called for an investigation of Price after CNN reported that Price bought up to $15,000 worth of stock in Zimmer Biomet -- a medical device maker -- and then introduced a measure that would have directly benefited the company. One week after Price bought the stock, he put in a measure that would have delayed a new regulation that would have harmed the company. "This is a very narrow, specific company that dealt with implants-hip and knee-and the legislation specifically affects implants. He puts it in a week after he buys the stock? That cries out for an investigation," Schumer told CNN. An aide to Price said that the stock was purchased by a broker without Price's knowledge at the time. This explanation led Schumer to offer the caveat that Price broke the law "if he knew about" the purchase before introducing the bill. Also on Tuesday, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders will meet with Price later Tuesday afternoon, one day before Price is set to testify before Congress, CNN has learned. The meeting was arranged per Sanders' request, according to a congressional source. During the meeting, Sanders - a former 2016 presidential candidate who put pressure on Hillary Clinton from the left - wants to discuss GOP efforts to overhaul Obamacare, also known as the Affordable Care Act. Sanders also plans to discuss a new Congressional Budget Report report out Tuesday that discusses the potential harmful effects of Republicans' plan to repeal Obamacare. Price is facing a critical nomination battle to serve as Health and Human Services secretary, a job which would place him at the front of ending Obamacare and crafting and managing the Republican alternative.

The documents shed some light on the agency's activities throughout the Vietnam, Korean and Cold War conflicts. It even includes documents pertaining to purported UFO sightings and the organization's "Star Gate" program investigating possible psychic abilities and what could be done with them. "Access to this historically significant collection is no longer limited by geography," said Joseph Lambert, the CIA's information management director in a press release. The agency hoped in October 2016 to have the archive publicly available online by the end of 2017, according to a source with knowledge of the agency's effort. The work was labor intensive, but the agency was able to complete this ahead of schedule as a result of significant advancements in technology and data management. The archive touches on the CIA extensive history as an organization, from its inception up through the 1990s. "None of this is cherry-picked," said CIA spokesperson Heather Fritz Horniak. "It's the full history. It's good and bads." Nothing in the archive is newly declassified. Although the documents are declassified, redactions do exist throughout the millions of pages. The redactions -- which Horniak describes as light -- were done to protect sources and methods that could potentially harm national security, she explained. The archive is massive, and new developments on the CIA's activities throughout its storied history are likely to come out as the millions of pages are reviewed.

Those sources said Republicans are working on a strategy to dismantle and replace the law in pieces. The comments come after Trump Lawmakers want to focus on lowering costs, not expanding coverage, which is one of the Democrats' main talking points. They are very wary of discussing how many people would be insured under their plan, aware that many Americans are concerned they'll lose their coverage under a would-be GOP overhaul. Instead, they are emphasizing more people will have access to more affordable policies. Trump did not offer any details on his plan, other than to say it would offer lower deductibles. He told the Post he is ready to release it with the congressional leadership's bills. Republican Sen. Roy Blunt told CNN that lawmakers are still learning how to interpret Trump's statements. "It's possible the information is conflicting, it's possible we're just not used to hearing the new president communicates yet," Blunt said of Trump's comments. The Missouri senator gave his interpretation of what Trump means when he says Obamacare will be repealed and replaced at the same time. "The president saying that this will be repealed and replaced at the same time doesn't necessarily mean it's in the same piece of legislation," Blunt said. "But you and I all hear it that way when we first hear it. But when he hears it he says, we've got a deadline when this goes away, we're going to have something to replace it by the time we get to that deadline or before." Meanwhile, Rep. Sean Duffy said Tuesday the Trump administration and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle will have to come together on a health care package. The Wisconsin Republican acknowledged the high hurdles to Trump's goal. "I'm looking forward to Mr. Trump's plan because I haven't seen it yet and I think it's tough to do," Duffy said on CNN's "New Day." Vice President-elect Mike Pence will be meeting one-on-one with a bipartisan mix of lawmakers Tuesday, including Democratic Sens. Heidi Heitkamp, Bill Nelson and Dianne Feinstein. Pence is Trump's key liaison to Capitol Hill and has taken a top role in discussing the upcoming Supreme Court nomination, Obamacare repeal and laying the groundwork for building a wall along the US-Mexico border. Pence could provide senators with some clarity about Trump's intentions, but one place senators likely won't get answers is at the confirmation hearing of his Health and Human Services secretary nomination. Tom Price has been kept out of the transition team's efforts to craft an Obamacare replacement plan so he can be shielded from answering questions, a senior transition official told CNN. ©As Democrats choose their next national party leader, the candidates vying for the job acknowledge one thing awaits the winner: A major credibility problem. The still-lingering tensions of the 2016 primary have dominated the contest so far to head the Democratic National Committee. But they have also masked the deeper problem: After a year of debate scheduling drama, hacked emails, questions about impartiality and former Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz's convention-eve resignation, many Democrats aren't convinced the DNC is even capable of playing a central role in the party's Donald Trump-era resistance. For backers of Bernie Sanders, the DNC isn't viewed as an honest broker. And on Hillary Clinton's side, the organization is seen as so beset by controversy that it might be more trouble than it's worth. Evidence of Democrats' distrust is already evident: Sanders has so far declined to share his massive fundraising list with the DNC, and former attorney general Eric Holder is heading a major new Democratic redistricting initiative, separate from the DNC. Within the race for DNC chair, Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison, Labor Secretary Tom Perez and five other candidates broadly agree that the party needs to invest deeply in state parties and in working-class America, that it needs new efforts toward protecting voting access and that the next chair must be a more successful fundraiser. First, though, even the contenders for chair acknowledge that the DNC must re-establish its credibility. "Listen, the DNC is now a weaker organization coming out of this election than it was going into it," Jaime Harrison, the South Carolina Democratic chairman and one of the seven candidates to helm the DNC, said Saturday in an interview with CNN at the first of four "future forums" the party is holding. "The question is how do you get it back on track? We're in the ditch -- how do we get it out of the ditch and then back on the road?" Harrison said. "I can understand the hesitation on people's parts and the hand-wringing that is going on -- because all of the things that took place in this past election were just really hard, and the hits just didn't stop." The candidates for DNC chair have largely rejected the characterization of the race as a Sanders vs. Clinton proxy battle -- in part because Ellison doesn't want his support limited to Sanders supporters and Perez knows he can't win without some backing from the party's ascendant progressives. But those tensions are evident in the race: Sanders has not committed to sharing his massive fundraising list with the DNC -- saying he wants to make sure it isn't diluted through use to bolster candidates that don't meet his progressive standards. That lack of a show of faith has angered many Democrats and threatens to hobble Ellison, who Sanders has endorsed. Perez, meanwhile, has aligned himself closely with President Barack Obama -- but his core argument for the job is that he can address the problems that languished during the Obama years. "The task ahead is the task of being a fixer-upper-in-chief, and I've prided myself on being the turnaround guy in the work that I've done," Perez said. He has offered a series of technical fixes -- starting with a unit dedicating to protecting voting access -- and says he could restore the party's lagging morale. "When people don't have a hop in their step when they get out of bed in the morning," he said, "they're not as productive." Perez said Democrats need an "honest broker" who runs a "transparent ship" and is "never in fact or in perception putting their thumb on the scales" in primaries, he said, to rebuild party loyalists' faith in the DNC as its central institution. "We have to earn it. We have to show people that we can do it," he said. Ellison, meanwhile, rejected the importance of helming the DNC as a nuts-and-bolts fix-it job. "The top priority's not a nuts-and-bolts thing. And I know reporters and Washington political types -- they just want to go to the nuts and bolts. But the most important thing is attitudinal," Ellison said. "We didn't arrive where we are because we got nuts and bolts wrong. Nuts and bolts flow from core motivation and purpose," he said. "If you get purpose right, everything tends to flow in the right direction after that. It's amazing how easy things become after you get the purpose right." Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, entered the race late and is basing his candidacy on the rejection of a second Sanders-against-Clinton battle -- and on the argument that as a local official, he could shift the party's focus away from Washington. "One of the things you could sense in the crowd, right, amongst the DNC members, is they don't feel connected to the mother ship," he said. Buttigieg said that for the next DNC chair, "the fundraising role is huge," and that "we need the buy-in and the investment from Democrats in every part of the country." But, he said, the DNC is an organization badly in need of a new chief executive. "We don't seem to have any kind of strategic plan -- we just go from one cycle to the next," he said. "We've got to just do the bread-and-butter, how do you run the organization right, before we can really get into any of the spiffy innovation things that I want to do." Ray Buckley -- a long-time New Hampshire Democratic chair, floated the idea of "co-chairs" leading the DNC -- with one focused on presenting the party's message on TV and the other handling the internal, technical challenges. That idea didn't gain traction, so he entered the race himself. Buckley said the party's handling of the 2016 race was deeply flawed. "The very first thing I'd do is address the issues that came to light in the nominating process: the neutrality of the chair and the staff; superdelegates; the joint fundraising agreement; how the caucuses are just so wildly different from one state to another and there's no support; and the debate schedule," he said. "None of that had to happen," Buckley said. "None of it." "None of that had to happen," Buckley said. "None of it." ©During the campaign, Donald Trump's inner circle was so small, it fit on his election night stage. Now, a handful of those top advisers will follow the President-elect into the West Wing, influencing policy and helping to guide the first-time politician through his first months as President. The rough and tumble team that led Trump's unprecedented campaign and now will shape his new administration include the top Republican Party leader, a controversial media mogul, Trump's son-in-law, and his third -- and final -- campaign manager. Leading the group as Trump's new chief of staff is former RNC Chair Reince Priebus, who kept an arms' length distance from the billionaire during the Republican primary. Priebus then used a ground operation he spent years building up to help Trump win the presidency. In the new administration, Priebus will be both doorkeeper to the Oval Office and a conductor keeping White House trains running. But his most difficult and important job will be trying to keep Trump himself on track. That's not a small task for a candidate who broke all the rules during his campaign and has spent his transition period communicating about international policy through Twitter. His partner in that task is Steve Bannon, the former head of Breitbart News who Trump has named chief strategist and senior counselor. Bannon and Priebus will work side-by-side in the White House, but their political philosophies have been markedly different. Sources familiar with their relationship say Trump respects Bannon as an equal, and his role in the new administration will be to work with the President-elect on shaping the big picture. Bannon outlined some of that vision in rare interview with Breitbart News Media after the election. "The hobbits or the deplorables had a great run in '16," Bannon said. "Everyone mocked then and ridiculed them and now they've spoken. I think '17 is going to be a very exciting year. I think the key is hold people accountable." Then, there is Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, who will be the only family member to get an official administration title: White House senior advisor. The official role for Kushner is unusual, if not unprecedented, and will allow him to continue the integral role he played through Trump's campaign: organizing, advising, and now, sources say, playing conduit to Trump's cabinet. In interviews since the election, Trump has said he wants Jared working on foreign policy, specifically on a deal for peace in the Middle East. In an interview with CNN prior to the election, Trump's former campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, described a very close relationship with Trump's son-in-law who was integrally involved in running the campaign, especially on budgeting. "I'm very close to Jared. We talk many times a day," she said. "He's obviously a brilliant businessman." Conway, who has in many ways become the face of team Trump, also still has a considerable amount of influence with the President-elect and will serve as counselor to the President in the new administration. Another Trump insider, David Urban, who ran the billionaire's campaign in Pennsylvania and worked closely with Trump and his family, described Kushner as a "very thoughtful, bright individual who listens to lots of folks" and is "very collaborative in his decision making process." Urban said Trump's inner circle is made up of four "very important" people: Jared, Reince, Steve, and Kellyanne. "They all get to bend his ear," Urban said. "And when things get done, they're all at the table." Remaining outside that official White House inner circle will be one of Trump's closest advisers, his daughter Ivanka. As her husband joins the administration in a formal capacity, Ivanka has said she will spend time settling their three children into life in Washington. While her official role is still to be determined, transition aides have already started reaching out to congressional staff on childcare proposals -- the policy issue she spearheaded during her father's campaign. Trump's team may be unconventional, but the idea of a powerful inner circle has precedence in prior administrations. The small group of influential advisers surrounding Trump may be most similar to the so-called Big Three that Ronald Reagan began his presidency with: Ed Meese III, James Baker III, and Michael Deaver. They referred to themselves as "the triumvirate" because they worked so closely together. They were thought of as the most powerful group in Washington until infighting broke up the group. Unlike the President-elect, George W. Bush took office with a large team of campaign advisers. But as with Trump, only a few really had sway: Karen Hughes, Vice President Dick Cheney, and famous Bush strategist Karl Rove. Still, one transition source compared the Trump structure to that of President Barack Obama at the start of his first term when David Axelrod, Valerie Jarrett and Rahm Emanuel split responsibilities. Regardless of who is advising a president, a key question is how he ultimately makes decisions. Urban said based on his time working closely with Trump during the campaign that the President-elect takes advice from "a wide range of individuals both on a formal and informal basis." He described Trump as involved on a "granular level" in the Pennsylvania campaign -- even calling Urban personally to ask about details of their state strategy. When it comes to management style, Urban said Trump is "informal" and as someone who likes action. "He is someone who wants answers, "Urban said. "He has an action-bias." Words from the past: Inauguration speech library According to other sources familiar with how Trump operates, his decision-making process varies with the subject matter. If it is an issue that Trump is comfortable with, he makes quick confident decisions. When it is an issue that he is unsure about, such as whether to select Mitt Romney for secretary of state, he can be swayed by the last person in the room. And on issues he knows little about, such as picks for top intelligence jobs, he turns to those who do know, like his incoming Vice President Mike Pence. Trump, like most leaders, also relies on a kitchen cabinet of close friends and confidantes, including hedge fund manager Anthony Scaramucci, who will also take a White House job. During the campaign, this small circle managed to successfully steer Trump to victory, but the task at hand changes at noon on Friday. It remains to be seen how this inner circle will run the White House and, more importantly, how Trump will perform as President.

One case in point is likely to be Rep. Tom Price when he takes his turn for confirmation hearings on Wednesday. The Georgia Republican has previously introduced his own legislation to repealing and replacing Obamacare. But the Health and Human Services nominee has been assiduously kept out in the dark on Trump's replacement plan in an effort to inoculate him from fielding questions about it during his hearing, according to a senior transition official. Price is expected to say he hasn't been involved in the planning efforts if he is asked what the administration intends to do about the Affordable Care Act, the source said. Instead, Price will try to focus on his potential role as a policy implementer as opposed to get into the details of setting policy, an official said. Price will be just the latest example of a Cabinet pick avoiding future policy details during a confirmation hearing. The tactic prevents a nomination from getting stymied thanks to a potentially unpopular policy and prevents the nominee from saying something that the future administration would be held account for. Trump's State Department nominee Rex Tillerson and Department of Homeland Security nominee John Kelly both pleaded ignorance when asked specifics about their plans at agencies and what conversations they've had with Trump himself on the topic. Tillerson, the longtime Exxon CEO, drew amazement from New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez when he said he has only spoken to Trump about the world in general terms and has had no specific conversations about Russia, its President Vladimir Putin and Moscow's attempts to influence the election, one of the Hill's biggest concerns on both sides of the aisle. "That has not yet occurred," Tillerson said. "That's pretty amazing," Menendez responded. In similar fashion, Kelly, a retired general, told senators he has not been involved in policy conversations about how to proceed on the campaign promise of deporting undocumented immigrants. Kelly said only that he expects undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children, who were protected from deportation under an Obama administration policy, will not be first on the list for enforcement actions. "The entire development of immigration policy is ongoing right now in terms of the upcoming administration," Kelly said. "I have not been involved in those discussions. If confirmed, I think -- I know -- I will be involved in those discussions." One nominee did admit to in-depth discussions with Trump on policy matters, but still demurred on what the administration was planning. Retired Gen. James Mattis, nominated to be defense secretary, told Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain that he is a strong supporter of the US alliance with NATO, and has expressed that to the President-elect. Trump has been an outspoken critic of NATO throughout the campaign. "I have had discussions with him on this issue," Mattis said. "He has shown himself open, even to the point of asking more questions and going deeper into the issue about why I feel so strongly." But Mattis said working through what the administration's vision is will wait until the national security team is assembled. "He understands where I stand, and I'll work with the other members of the team, the national security team, once the Senate confirms them, to carry these views forward," Mattis said. Mattis and Trump's attorney general nominee, Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, also deployed another tried-and-true tactic in their hearings -- declining comment due to ignorance. "I'm not current on this," Mattis said to a question about specific Syria strategy. "If confirmed I will get current as fast as I can." Sessions said he had "not studied" four different issues, and said he didn't have enough "research" on three others. Some of the subjects Sessions demurred on included hot topics, like the guidelines put out by the Obama administration on Department of Justice pursuit of journalists and their sources, how the emoluments clause of the Constitution applies to the President on conflicts of interest, Voting Rights Act enforcement and overseeing the appeals court for immigration proceedings. A transition official who worked on nominee prep said it's natural for nominees to wait on some details -- especially given that they will not be operating in a vacuum if confirmed. "Sometimes the questions are asking for a level of detail that it just wouldn't be prudent to answer," the official said, "in terms of getting ahead of the policy experts that you should talk to and who have been working at that department or who you are going to bring into that department." And, of course, the official added that a lot will be up to the President-elect. "You never want to get ahead of the boss." "You never want to get ahead of the boss." ©President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the Environmental Protection Agency told the Senate he doesn't believe climate change is a "hoax." The nominees for secretary of state, energy and interior said the same thing. But what they also all added, using very similar language, is that they aren't certain about the level of impact humans are having on global warming and remain skeptical about the need for urgent action on climate change. This despite the strong consensus among scientists that greenhouse gas emissions are a prime driver of global warming and associated impacts such as rising sea levels. The questions from Democrats in the hearings are based off Trump once calling climate change a "hoax" invented by the Chinese. His nominees all disagreed with that notion. "I do not ... I do not believe climate change is a hoax," Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt told the Senate Environmental and Public Works Committee Wednesday. Then, he disagreed with the scientific consensus around climate change. "I believe the ability to measure with precision the degree that human activity is impacting the climate is subject to more debate on whether the climate is changing or whether human activity contributes to it," Pruitt said when pressed by Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. As Trump comes into office with a call for increased production of oil, gas and coal -- and prepares to attempt to roll back some of President Barack Obama's environmental regulations, the issue is of prime concern to Democrats. When Interior secretary nominee Ryan Zinke hedged during his hearing Tuesday, Sen. Al Franken, D-Minnesota, pounced "I want to be honest with you," Zinke said. "We both agree that the climate's changing. We both agree that man is an influence." "A major influence," Franken responded. "I'm not an expert in this field," Zinke said. "To me that's a cop-out," Franken said. "I'm not a doctor but I have to make health care decisions." Trump, too, has also more recently acknowledged "some connectivity" between human activity and climate change. And just like his Cabinet picks, Trump has argued that there is an ongoing debate about "how much" man-made emission of greenhouse gases have contributed to the changing climate. And he has made clear that he is more concerned about the economic effects of restricting the fossil fuel industry than the environmental and human cost of climate change and its effects. "It also depends on how much it's going to cost companies," Trump said during a November meeting with New York Times reporters and editors after his election. Energy secretary nominee Rick Perry said Thursday that he believes the "climate is changing" and that "some of it is naturally occurring, but some of it is also caused by man made activity" -- and also brought up the economic issue. "The question is, how do we address it in a thoughtful way that doesn't compromise economic growth?" Perry said, adding later that he is "committed to making decisions based on sound science and that also take into account the economic impact." Rex Tillerson, the ExxonMobil chief nominated for secretary of state for his part, said during his confirmation hearing he believes "the risk of climate change does exist," "the increase in greenhouse gas in the atmosphere are having an effect" and vaguely offered that "action should be taken." But Tillerson gave no indication of what that "action" would look like or whether it would be a priority -- and also questioned the science. "The increase in the greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere are having an effect. Our ability to predict that effect is very limited," he said, a statement at odds with scientists' assessments of most climate change effects. Tillerson, for his part, took steps in his leadership of the world's largest oil company to acknowledge the reality of climate change and supported global action on the issue.

Scott Mason, who worked as the Trump campaign's director of congressional relations for the House of Representatives, is joining the top government affairs firm Holland & Knight later this month, a source familiar with the move told CNN on Tuesday. A spokeswoman for Holland & Knight confirmed the hire. Mason will take on a role as senior policy adviser in the firm's public policy and regulatory practice division, where he will help the firm navigate the waters of dealing with the Trump administration. He is likely to eventually register as a lobbyist to push the agenda of the firm's clients in Washington, the source familiar with the move said. He had been offered a post in the Trump administration as a senior White House adviser at the Department of Interior, a new position the Trump administration is planning on adding within executive departments to better coordinate with the White House on its policy and political agenda, the source said. The hire comes as Trump prepares to take office and where he will be tested to implement his rhetorical promise to "drain the swamp," a pledge he made to voters that he would work to rid Washington of special interests. As part of that plan, Trump has promised to institute a ban barring administration officials from working as lobbyists for five years after leaving the White House. But that decision is also making some wary of joining the administration, and the source familiar with Mason's hire said the five-year ban was a factor in his decision not to join the administration. Mason, a North Carolina native, previously headed up the government affairs division at Lowe's for 10 years before joining the Trump campaign, where he became one of the campaign's first Washington-based staffers. Sen. Richard Burr, R-North Carolina, and Rep. Chris Collins, R-New York, both lent their voices to praise Mason in a press release the lobbying giant Holland & Knight plans to publicly release later Tuesday. Burr noted that he's worked with Mason since his first term in Congress and cited his relationships on Capitol Hill and with the incoming administration as a "huge asset for him." Collins, who led the pro-Trump caucus on Capitol Hill, credited Mason with helping build support for Trump on Capitol Hill.

Some US enemies like Russia are becoming his friends, and longtime US allies like Germany are wondering whether America will be there for them any more. Geopolitical groups and alliances like the EU and NATO that have underpinned US global leadership for generations are reeling from Trump's disparaging comments. Amid the tumult, world leaders are hurriedly repositioning themselves to deal with the new world disorder that the incoming American president seems to herald. China, for example, despite its Communist political system is moving into a vacuum left by Trump's hostility to free trade deals to position itself as the champion of unfettered and open commerce. Russian President Vladimir Putin is emerging as Trump's most vocal defender, despite allegations of Moscow having cyber hacked in the US election. In the Arab world, US allies are mustering to head off the firestorm they fear if Trump honors his campaign vow to move the US Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. And in the Western Hemisphere, another traditional American friend, Mexico, is insisting it won't pay for the wall Trump has pledged to build on the Southern border. Even Canada is bracing for tense ties with its neighbor since the President-elect has promised to renegotiate NAFTA. It all means that the 45th president will take office with foreign allies and adversaries alike puzzled -- and, in some cases, alarmed -- that the certainties which have underpinned US foreign policy for generations no longer seem to apply. America, always looked to for stability, continuity and as a guarantor of the liberal world order, now could become under Trump one of the most disruptive global forces -- at least if he follows through on his threats. His hyperactive transition that has rattled the rest of the world will ensure he faces a string of simmering foreign policy questions as soon as he takes office. US presidents have for decades based policy toward China on the need to avoid a clash between the world's last real superpower and the dominant power in Asia. Trump, however, seems to be doing exactly the opposite. He's spent his transition tweaking Beijing over the status of Taiwan, warning against its territorial ventures in the South China Sea, and warning of a tough new initiative to wring a better deal on trade issues out of the Asian giant. Many foreign policy experts agree that Washington needs to adopt a more robust posture toward China and accuse the Obama administration of not doing enough to protect US interests in the region. But few would endorse Trump's chosen strategy of sending volleys toward Beijing on Twitter. China's President Xi Jinping on Tuesday, in unusually frank terms for a Chinese leader, delivered a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos that appeared to be an open repudiation of much of Trump's emerging China policy. He denied that Beijing was guilty of devaluing its currency as charged by the President-elect and warned that a trade war would benefit no one. "There's no point in blaming economic globalization for the world's problems," Xi told the world's economic elite at the Swiss ski resort. Xi also warned that the world must remain committed to free trade and said protectionism was akin to locking "oneself in a dark room," apparently taking aim at Trump's threats to impose tariffs on Chinese goods because of his belief Beijing has ripped off America in their economic relationship. Xi also delivered a veiled warning to Trump not to tear up the global pact to limit greenhouse gas emissions last year, following the President-elect's warnings to do just that once he comes into office. Xi suggested that China intends to move quickly to identify economic opportunities from what it clearly believes is a pullback by the new Trump administration on leadership on global trade. US-Russia relations haven't been this bad since the end of the Cold War. The Obama administration and the Kremlin have been estranged over President Vladimir Putin's apparent attempts to undermine US power and Western-style liberalism, over the incursion into Ukraine and an alleged Russian espionage operation to help throw last year's election to Trump. Now Putin, who is hoping Trump's vow to improve relations will mean he is open to Moscow's foreign policy priorities, is paying Trump back for his warm comments toward the Russian leader throughout his campaign and transition. "I don't know what he will be doing on the international stage. So I have no foundation to criticize him nor to defend him," Putin said on Tuesday. The Russian leader dismissed accusations that Moscow's intelligence agencies had amassed incriminating financial and personal information against Trump in order to compromise the new US president. "These things that have been alleged are clearly false information," Putin said. But the solicitous comments that fly back and forth frequently between Trump and Moscow are causing consternation among foreign policy experts and sparking alarm about the President-elect's motives in Europe. Some are noting that Moscow has far more to gain than the US through a possible rapprochement, including its hopes for a lifting of US sanctions, de-facto recognition of its annexation of Crimea, and a more skeptical US view of NATO. Comments by Trump in an interview with the Times of London and the German newspaper Bild over the weekend questioning the utility of the Western alliance, predicting more departures from the EU, and recreating some kind of great power deal-making relationship on issues like fighting terrorism and bargaining nuclear weapons, caused alarm throughout Europe. "What Mr. Trump articulated in this series of interviews ... that is exactly the goals and aspirations of the Kremlin: to erode NATO 's credibility, to erode the European Union and to conquer and divide, to get to a great power relationship on arms control where it is back to the future and two great powers will solve everything," said Heather Conley, director of the European affairs program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "Those are Russian interests," she added. It takes a lot to shock German Chancellor Angela Merkel. And, publicly at least, she was unruffled when Trump implied to the European journalists that he trusted Putin just as much as he did , at least for now. But the idea that an American President could be as warm to a Russian leader accused of interfering in the US election than a German chancellor shocked many observers. "Chancellor Merkel is the leader of Germany, which has been a very close American ally for decades," former US Ambassador to Ukraine Stephen Pifer told CNN on Tuesday. "To put them on the same plane is a pretty remarkable statement that has caused a lot of concern not just in Washington, but I think among American allies in Europe about what the Trump presidency is going to mean for how the United States engages with Europe and deals with Russia." Trump's statements in the weekend interview triggered disbelief in Europe. NATO and the European Union are considered centerpieces of a largely successful political effort to purge Europe of the bloodletting that stained its history for hundreds of years. Yet Trump seems to have little use for either institution, which are both already facing pressure from the populist economic forces that the President-elect harnessed in the US election as well as Moscow's most belligerent behavior since the end of the Cold War. Trump was asked whether a strong Europe or stronger nation-states was most important to the US. "Personally, I don't think it matters much for the United States. I never thought it mattered," he said. "Look, the EU was formed, partially, to beat the United States on trade, OK? So, I don't really care whether it's separate or together, to me it doesn't matter." Trump's comments represented a departure from decades of US foreign policy. Despite tensions and differences with the bloc, Washington's preference has always been for a strong, united EU because it represents a fellow anchor of the world's liberal, open, trading and political system. Trump's attitude toward NATO caused similar disquiet among Atlanticists. The 28-nation Western alliance was set up in the late 1940s to guard against a rising Soviet threat. Many of its members, particularly in former Warsaw Pact countries now feel a similar threat from Moscow's territorial maneuverings. The President-elect, however, considers NATO "obsolete" largely because he believes it is not doing enough to deal with terrorism, despite the fact that the only time that NATO's Article 5 mutual defense provision has ever been invoked was after a terrorist attack - on September 11, 2001. Since then, thousands of NATO troops have served in Afghanistan, fighting to stop the war-ravaged country from again becoming a haven for extremist groups like al Qaeda. "We were attacked on 9/11, and not any of these countries and they sent their young men and women to serve in Afghanistan, and over 1,000 were killed in Afghanistan," Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain said on CNN's "New Day" on Tuesday. "Not because they were attacked but because we were attacked." Former Sen. and Middle East peace negotiator George Mitchell, meanwhile, argued that Trump risked subverting one of America's great achievements: the building of a new transatlantic order from the rubble of two world wars in which 68 million people died. "I believe historians will judge that to be one of America's finest hours," said Mitchell on CNN Tuesday. "I believe historians will judge that to be one of America's finest hours," said Mitchell on CNN Tuesday. ©President-elect Last month, Trump told guests at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, as well as presidential historian Douglas Brinkley, that he planned to write the speech himself. On Wednesday, Trump on social media shared an image of him writing what he said was his inaugural address at the estate last month. The decision is a departure from how Trump tackled speeches during the campaign, when he either delivered off-the-cuff remarks or relied on text prepared by his senior policy adviser, Stephen Miller. It's unclear exactly to what extent Miller has been involved in fine-tuning Trump's draft.

Trump officially becomes President at noon and will take the oath of office at his inauguration around that time. It's a historic moment as a man who has never before served in government ascends to the nation's highest public office. Here are a few things to know if you want to watch the festivities that make up the beginning of Trump's presidency. The inauguration is the formal transfer of power from one president to the next. On Friday, President Barack Obama will complete his second term in office and cease to be the sitting president, transferring the authority of his office to his elected successor, Trump. At noon, Trump will become the President and Vice President-elect Mike Pence will become the sitting vice president. Trump will take the oath of office administered by Chief Justice John Roberts and deliver a speech commemorating the occasion. And The inauguration ceremony is sandwiched amidst days of events, including lavish dinners, the parade and concerts. Thursday kicks off the first An event billed as "The Make America Great Again! Welcome Celebration" will be at Lincoln Memorial at 4 p.m. ET and open to the public. Artists including Toby Keith, 3 Doors Down and Lee Greenwood are scheduled to perform. The inaugural committee also announced another pre-inaugural celebration, called "Voices of the People," which the team said "will feature groups from the hundreds of applications received by the Presidential Inaugural Committee to take part in inaugural festivities." After Friday's official ceremonies, inaugural balls are also part of the week's traditions. Trump Didn't get an invite to one of the official balls but still want a night on the town? A number of organizations sell tickets to their own balls during inauguration week. There are also a number of Official inauguration coverage on television begins at 5 a.m. ET live from Washington and will continue through the inaugural events. CNN will carry the official ceremonies like the swearing-in, the parade, the inaugural balls and all the official events as well as coverage of protests, executive actions and everything else that happens throughout the weekend. Television coverage will come on CNN, CNNI and CNN en Espaxc3xb1ol. Live streaming will be available right on Additionally, CNN Politics will have a live blog for instant coverage and analysis on Inauguration Day and the women's march on Saturday. It depends on how close to the action you want to be. Anybody can go watch for free from the National Mall. But watching from the West Front of the Capitol Building requires a ticket. The inaugural event itself is a tightly formal affair on Capitol Hill and attendance is managed by a bipartisan team of congressional leaders and the President-elect's inaugural committee. Members of Congress, Supreme Court justices, members of the transition team, family members and other invited guests can attend, with some sitting on the inaugural platform where the President takes the oath office. Former presidents and their families have also agreed to attend, including former President Bill Clinton and former secretary of state and first lady Hillary Clinton, who Trump defeated in the election. Former President George H.W. Bush and his wife, Barbara Bush, had agreed to attend, but they have both been Everyone else has to get tickets from their members of Congress, which are necessarily limited. Members of the House and Senate each receive tickets from the Joint Congressional Committee for the ceremonies. Members of the House and Senate distribute tickets to those who have applied. Competition can be fierce because more people generally apply for tickets than are available. Exact times and methods for distribution vary from member to member, but less than a week ahead of the inauguration, it is unlikely for anyone new to score tickets to the area closest to the inaugural platform. Pack your ponchos -- according to the For those planning on joining the women's march or looking to do sightseeing, Saturday's forecast is 56xcbx9a and cloudy. The Women's March on Washington, a protest against Trump, is on Saturday. It is scheduled to begin with a rally at 10 a.m., followed by the march at 1:15 p.m. The group says not only women are invited -- anyone who thinks "women's rights are human rights" is welcome. The Security will be a massive presence in the nation's capital. Homeland Security estimated about 28,000 personnel from many different agencies would join in for the job. The president and the first lady will attend the swearing-in ceremony, then they have planned to head to But soon, they will settle into their new home in a Trump's eldest daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner, an incoming White House member, have also President Andrew Jackson is said to have thrown a wild party and even escaped through a White House window to avoid the chaos. President William Henry Harrison caught pneumonia that led to his early death in office. The drama is not just limited to Democrats though. We don't know what the speech is yet, and knowing Trump, it could include some improvised moments anyway. But In the morning, he'll have tea with the Obamas. Then, after taking the oath, Trump will have lunch with lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Here's Trump's Reps. Barbara Lee and John Lewis, progressive Democrats, announced they would not attend the inauguration. After Lewis said Trump was not a "legitimate" president, Trump attacked the Civil Rights icon for days. Meanwhile, the number of Democrats boycotting the event snowballed. It's always hard to estimate crowd sizes, but many hundreds of thousands could show. In comparison, estimates pegged Obama's In comparison, estimates pegged Obama's ©Donald Trump said Rep. John Lewis is "wrong" to suggest that the President-elect's inauguration is the first he will boycott such an event, citing the Georgia congressman also protested the first inauguration of George W. Bush. "John Lewis said about my inauguration, 'It will be the first one that I've missed.' WRONG (or lie)! He boycotted Bush 43 also because he thought it would be hypocritical to attend Bush's swearing-in....he doesn't believe Bush is the true elected president.' Sound familiar," the President-elect wrote in two consecutive tweets on Tuesday. Lewis' office acknowledged that Lewis had protested a previous inauguration. "Rep. Lewis also missed one other inauguration, the first inauguration of President George W. Bush," a statement from Lewis' office read. "His absence at that time was also a form of dissent. He did not believe the outcome of that election, including the controversies around the results in Florida and the unprecedented intervention of the US Supreme Court, reflected a free, fair and open democratic process." Like Trump, Bush was also elected after failing to win the popular vote. A Lewis had said his plans to skip Trump's inauguration would make it the first inauguration he missed attend since coming to Washington in 1986. The Georgia Democrat said he doesn't see Trump as a "legitimate" commander in chief due to intelligence about Russia meddling in the 2016 election. "I don't see this President-elect as a legitimate president," the Georgia Democrat told NBC News' Chuck Todd. "I think the Russians participated in helping this man get elected. And they helped destroy the candidacy of Hillary Clinton." ©On Friday at noon, Yet, just days away from the White House, the President-elect is sparking transatlantic turbulence by expressing fresh disdain for the two institutions that have been the bedrock of post-World War II peace, stability and prosperity -- NATO and the European Union. It is too early to tell how the Trump administration will shift America's stance toward Europe, since details have been at a premium both during the election campaign and the transition when policy often has been announced 140 characters on Twitter. But European governments worried about Trump's arrival in the White House now have new reasons to be fearful. Fresh comments by Trump in an interview with two European journalists raise the extraordinary scenario of a new American president who seems to question the fundamental purpose of Western security infrastructure -- an unthinkable prospect ever since the defeat of Nazism and throughout the Cold War. The President-elect warned that NATO was "obsolete," criticized German Chancellor Angela Merkel's policy of welcoming Middle Eastern refugees as a mistake, and predicted the United Kingdom would not be the last nation to leave the EU. Although he said Europe could still count on US security guarantees and that he felt "very strongly" toward the continent, Trump's comments on NATO were a stunning departure for someone who will be President in a few days. "No one in mainstream political life has ever questioned NATO and US membership in it," said Jamie Kirchick, a journalist who specializes in foreign policy and the author of "The End of Europe: Dictators, Demagogues and the Coming Dark Age," to be published in March. While other US presidents and officials have long vented frustration at the failure of all NATO members to meet their funding commitments, "never have you had someone come out and say NATO is obsolete," Kirchick said. Former US ambassador to NATO Ivo Daalder expressed the sense of unpredictability in a tweet, warning: "Trump is more critical of NATO, EU, & Germany -- all close allies -- than he's ever been of Putin & Russia. We're entering an upside down world." Trump argued in a press conference last week that it would be an "asset" to America if he could forge a good relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, defending his openness to dialogue with a leader who many of his own fellow Republicans view as an unrepentant enemy of the United States. Trump's new salvo means Europe's leaders can no longer console themselves with the thought that Trump's contempt for the transatlantic establishment and tolerance for the world view of Russian President Vladimir Putin can be easily dismissed as the fungible rhetoric of a populist campaigner that will disappear once he's confronted with the responsibilities of being President. As commander-in-chief, Trump will be in a position to emulate -- on an even wider, global, stage with higher stakes -- the disruption and convention-busting style that shook the Washington establishment. That could mean a rocky time is beckoning for US allies as he questions the unchallenged assumptions that have underlined US power in the world for decades. At the very least, Trump's blast toward Europe is causing confusion about the future course of US foreign policy, given that it differs sharply from the strong pro-NATO, anti-Russia line stated by several of his cabinet nominees, including defense secretary designate James Mattis, last week. In a joint interview with the German newspaper Bild and the Times of London, Trump renewed his contention that NATO is outdated because it has failed to fight terrorism, even though the alliance has been fighting to prevent Afghanistan becoming a terror haven again for years since 9/11. Tearing at fragile European divisions, he described the EU as a "vehicle" for German control, and praised Britain for voting to leave -- breaking with decades of US foreign policy orthodoxy that sees a strong, unified Europe as vital to global security. The President-elect also said he had equal trust for Merkel, the undisputed first among equals of European leaders and strong supporter of the transatlantic alliance, and Putin, who US intelligence agencies have accused of interfering in the election. And shredding taboos about intervening in the campaign politics of a foreign nation, Trump caused Merkel a political headache in a tough re-election year by saying that though he respected and admired her, the German leader's decision to welcome hundreds of thousands of Middle East refugees was "catastrophic." German Foreign Minister Frank Walter Steinmeier said Trump's comments caused "astonishment and agitation" in Europe. "I have just had a conversation with the NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, who is concerned that President-elect Trump regards NATO as obsolete," Steinmeier said. Merkel's office was more tempered, pledging to work closely with the new US president. But other European officials rejected Trump's view that the EU was about to fall apart and they took the line that once it takes power soon, the Trump administration will undaerstand the stakes in Europe and adjust policy accordingly. "For the last 70 years, Europe and the US have always agreed on one thing -- and that is European unity is in the interests of both parties, both the US and Europe," Frans Timmermans, vice president of the European Commission, told CNN's Christiane Amanpour. "We have built from scratch something that is arguably the most successful peace project in human history," he added. "I am sure that sooner or later, everyone in Washington will understand that it is in the strategic interests of the United States to have a successful European Union." Trump's comments on NATO are consistent with the campaign rhetoric in which he expressed a transactional role of US global alliances, complaining that Washington's partners are not paying enough for defense. But they are also a startling departure from seven decades of US foreign policy orthodoxy that has used NATO and alliances in Asia to project US power in defense of a liberal, democratic world order. Given all this, Trump's inauguration on Friday will open a period of uncertainty for US allies. "We have never had a President-elect quite like Mr. Trump," former US Middle East peace negotiator Aaron David Miller told CNN on Monday, heralding a new and unpredictable phase dawning in America's relationship with Europe and the world. "In four days, the ultimate pivot is coming, when, in fact, Mr. Trump will bear responsibility for existing and future US foreign policy." NATO nations will have to decide whether they believe Mattis that NATO is a "vital" US national security interest or take Trump's comments at face value. Some European governments had been assured by indications earlier in the transition that Trump was backing away from his campaign rhetoric. For instance, in a call with British Prime Minister Theresa May in December, a Downing Street statement said the two leaders agreed "on the importance of the Alliance." But Trump's new comments to the Times and Bild could undermine those hopes. One possible explanation for the President-elect's anti-NATO rhetoric is that, as in many other areas -- for instance China policy, where he has tweaked Beijing over Taiwan -- Trump may be adopting hardline positions that are meant to shock as an opening negotiating position. He's often said he wants to be unpredictable. "In this case, it is impossible to know, is this an effort on the part of the President-elect to be predictable, to keep allies and adversaries off balance?" asked Miller. In NATO's case, Trump's aim could be to cajole more members to reach the 2% threshold of GDP target on defense spending required by the alliance. "One thing's for sure, European nations will have to take more responsibility for their own security," said Timmermans. "I'm a strong believer in NATO, it's indispensable. The only one who wants to see NATO fall is Putin." But Trump's approach and determination to improve strained US relations with Russia can only add to the deep uncertainty stalking Europe that is already strained by Britain's vote to leave the EU and critical elections looming in Germany and France, in which populist anti-establishment forces are on the rise, along with concerns about the specter of a rambunctious Russia to the east. Though NATO is a 28-member alliance run by a secretary general, it always takes its lead from the US, its most powerful and wealthy member. That makes for unprecedented times, with a US President who appears to doubt the alliance's role.

But in the six years that Scott Pruitt has served as the state's attorney general, Oklahoma has been rattled by hundreds of quakes with a magnitude of 3.0 and greater, with some areas facing the same level of risk as high-hazard parts of California. Scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey, Stanford University and the Oklahoma Geological Survey link the uptick in quakes -- many of which are low-magnitude -- to a wastewater disposal process related to hydraulic fracking. That's a procedure in which a mixture of chemical-laced fluids and sands are injected into wells deep beneath the state's surface to extract oil and gas. For the last several years, frightened residents waited in frustration as the state's regulatory arm, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission, slowly cranked into action -- and ultimately concluded the surge in earthquakes was directly related to operation of disposal wells, where the wastewater from oil and gas production is injected. In states such as California and New York, attorneys general have been quick to step in on environmental issues. But Pruitt, who is Pruitt embodies the rightward shift about to hit Washington later this week when Trump is sworn into office. He is one of the President-elect's most controversial Cabinet picks and his combative stance toward the EPA and his seeming disinterest in the earthquakes unnerving his constituents are among the reasons why. He was questioned on the connection between fracking and earthquakes Wednesday at his "I have acknowledged that I am concerned," Pruitt said in an exchange with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. "If that is the kind of EPA administrator you will be, you are not going to get my vote," Sanders responded before questioning moved on to other lawmakers. Many Republicans at the hearing saw Pruitt, who has sued the EPA more than a half-dozen times, as the right person to lead what they view as a wasteful agency that over-regulates. Pruitt declined to comment on the earthquakes or his tangles with the EPA before his confirmation hearing. But when asked about his role on the earthquakes, one of his spokesmen said the attorney general's office had "no legal authority in these matters" and referred questions to the Oklahoma Oil & Gas Association, as well as state regulators at the Oklahoma Corporation Commission, who have overseen the development of "directives" for companies on how they should address Oklahoma's increased seismicity. "I personally know Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, and can say that he has shared the Commission's concerns for Oklahoma's seismicity trends in recent years," Oklahoma Corporation Commissioner Todd Hiett said in a statement. Dana Murphy, the commission's Chairman-elect, added that "industry compliance" with their directives "has thus far been outstanding." "There has been no need to request assistance from the attorney general," Murphy said. Aides to Pruitt noted he worked closely with the state insurance commissioner to protect consumers from premium spikes in earthquake policies. But they said Pruitt did not have any direct control over the actions of the Oklahoma Corporation Commission unless its members were to act outside the confines of their authority. Complicating the debate, Oklahoma scientists and officials are still mapping all of the state's natural fault lines as they try to trace where the wastewater flows once it is injected underground -- so there have been disagreements both within the scientific community and among energy producers about the exact cause of each quake. Still, Pruitt's overall silence on how he would approach a difficult issue that has wreaked havoc in his state is noteworthy because the EPA, Over the last year, Oklahoma has become more aggressive in trying to stop the quakes. The state now requires more frequent reporting of the amount of wastewater injected into wells. It limits the amount that can be injected in certain areas. And it's developed quicker procedures to shut down wells if earthquakes occur nearby. But for a long time, many Oklahoma residents felt state officials were slow to act, and they have filed a series of class action lawsuits against oil and gas producers. One of the first legal cases was brought against oil and gas producers by a woman who was hit by flying stone while sitting in her recliner during a 5.7 quake in Prague, Oklahoma, in 2011. A lower state court initially threw out the suit, saying they didn't have jurisdiction over the matter. But the Oklahoma Supreme Court overturned the lower court's ruling in 2016, saying homeowners could sue energy companies for damages in state trial courts, giving them a right to a jury when seeking damages. The companies argued that the Oklahoma Corporation Commission -- not the state courts -- should handle damage claims because it oversees the regulations for oil and gas operations. The record-setting 5.8 quake in Pawnee, Oklahoma, in September led the Pawnee Nation, which unsuccessfully tried in 2015 to impose a moratorium on fracking on their tribal lands, to sue the US Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Bureau of Land Management asking them to void drilling permits for natural oil and gas wells. The Bureau of Indian Affairs declined to comment on the pending litigation and the Bureau of Land Management did not respond to a request for comment. For several years as the tremors increased in frequency, Andrew Knife Chief, executive director of the Pawnee Nation, said residents constantly came to him, asking what he could do to stop them. They were seeing mysterious fish kills in nearby rivers, and were increasingly concerned that their drinking water could become contaminated by wastewater disposal wells or contractors who hauled that wastewater away from the drilling sites. "We went from having a hundred (earthquakes) a year, maybe even fewer than that, to a couple of thousand a year -- and there were no signs of it slowing down between 2008 and 2015," Knife Chief said. "Then the frequency started to die down a little bit, but the intensity started to ramp up, so we really felt like we were in a shooting gallery here in Pawnee." The Pawnee quake also led another group of residents to file a lawsuit against more than two dozen energy companies, accusing them of "reckless disregard for public or private safety." Only two of those energy companies, Eagle Road Oil LLC and Cummings Oil Co., have been named in the lawsuit so far. Neither company responded to a request for comment but Eagle Road's parent company, Jericho Oil Corp., said in a "The earthquakes have emerged in Oklahoma much faster than the culture and the state infrastructure has been able to respond," said Pawnee Mayor Brad Sewell, noting that many Oklahomans don't have insurance for earthquakes and are concerned about their property values. "There's a sense that a lot of the officials are perhaps reluctant to upset the status of a major industry in this state. ...The wheels of government turn much more slowly than these earthquakes are occurring." Sewell, a Democrat, said "Pruitt is not even on my radar as far as earthquakes are concerned, and I guess that in itself is telling. While I don't know anything he has said specifically about saltwater wells and earthquakes, I've seen his comments on other environmental issues and it doesn't bode well with respect to earthquakes," he said, referring to Pruitt's aggressive posture toward the EPA in his lawsuits and other statements. Sewell said it's been a struggle to get Oklahomans who were affected by the September quake to come forward. "They don't have insurance, so they feel like they are out of luck," Sewell said in an interview with CNN. "This is actually a rather poor region and many of these people don't feel like they really have the resources to do anything about the damage they've experienced." Beyond the concerns of individual homeowners, environmentalists have continued to warn of the possibility of a catastrophic environmental disaster involving the many pipelines that crisscross Oklahoma. November's 5.0-magnitude earthquake in Cushing, Oklahoma, renewed those fears. The town is the site of the largest storage center for commercial crude oil in North America -- tens of millions of barrels of crude oil are stored there in what is known as the "pipeline crossroads of the world." "We have thousands of miles of pipelines running through our county," said Knife Chief, noting that the tribe is based just 25 miles from Cushing, "and we don't know where any of them are. Of course, it's a worry. It's a huge worry." Chad Warmington, President of the Oklahoma Oil and Gas Association, told CNN in a telephone interview that state officials, as well as responsible energy companies, are now aggressively tackling the problem. He pointed to predictions that the number of earthquakes will drop in the coming years, because of the new restrictions. Among the new restrictions, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission has called on energy producers to shut down some disposal wells and reduce the volume of wastewater injected in some sensitive areas by 40%. When asked whether Pruitt could have played a more prominent role, Warmington credited Oklahoma Republican Gov. Mary Fallin with pulling together the group in 2014 that decided what should be done about the earthquakes. Guided by several Stanford scientists and state geologists, the working group determined that the tremors were triggered by the enormous pressure that the oil and gas wastewater injections were putting on natural faults in the ground. "(Fallin) pulled together everybody who had a stake in what should be done about seismicity, and there wasn't a place for the attorney general, because he doesn't really have any role in the regulatory aspects of seismicity or oil and gas in Oklahoma," Warmington said. A spokesman for Fallin didn't comment on why Pruitt was not included in that working group. The surge in earthquakes in his home state has highlighted questions about Pruitt's closeness to the oil and gas industry, which is certain to be one of the most contentious lines of inquiry at his confirmation hearing. Pruitt has pledged to bring a different sensibility to the agency. "The American people are tired of seeing billions of dollars drained from our economy due to unnecessary EPA regulations, and I intend to run this agency in a way that fosters both responsible protection of the environment and freedom for American businesses," he said in a statement when he was named by Trump. Pruitt strengthened his ties to the energy industry when he headed the Republican Attorneys General Association. Using 2011 documents obtained from open records requests, A staunch social conservative, he focused during his eight years in the Oklahoma State Senate on anti-abortion measures, religious freedom and fiscal responsibility. He ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 2001 and Lieutenant Governor in 2006, before winning an election for attorney general in 2010 and pursuing a bold agenda to challenge Obama administration regulations on everything from health care to the Clean Power Plan. Pruitt is expected to win congressional approval to head the EPA. But the stage is set for enormous clashes ahead with environmental advocates, who are already questioning whether he should recuse himself when dealing with issues that he has sued the EPA over, like the Clean Power Plan and the Waters of the United States rule. Environmental advocates argue his nomination effectively invites the fox to guard the henhouse. They point to the fact that Trump's energy adviser, Harold Hamm, the CEO and chairman of Oklahoma-based Continental Resources, served as the chairman of Pruitt's re-election campaign in 2013. In 2014, Pruitt joined the Domestic Energy Producer's Alliance in a lawsuit against the federal government as it prepared to determine the protective status of more than 200 animal species. Hamm, who chairs the Domestic Energy Producers Alliance, was concerned about one species in particular: the prairie chicken. If added to the endangered species list, Hamm was There are few examples of the coziness between state government officials and big energy companies that are quite as brazen, however, as the relationship that The New York Times revealed between Pruitt and one of Oklahoma's largest oil and gas companies, Devon Energy. Through open-records requests, the Pulitzer-Prize winning investigation uncovered a letter from Pruitt to the EPA that was drafted by Devon Energy. The letter argued that regulators were exaggerating the amount of methane emissions from natural gas production. Pruitt argued that the EPA calculations were wrong and that their methodology could inflict economic harm on an industry that is "critically important to the state of Oklahoma." Pruitt's letter was sent on state stationery to the EPA with a mere 37 words changed from the original draft that Devon Energy provided to attorney general's office. He later told The Journal Record, an Oklahoma newspaper, that it "should come as no surprise that I am working diligently with Oklahoma energy companies, the people of Oklahoma and the majority of attorneys general to fight the unlawful overreach of the EPA and other federal agencies." Though he has not been an active voice on the earthquake issue, as attorney general Pruitt has not shied away as attorney general from the issue of hydraulic fracturing. He offered a preview in 2014 of how he as EPA chief might approach matters related to fracking as EPA chief. At the time, he wrote the EPA's Office of the Inspector General questioning its motives as it prepared to investigate the ability of the EPA and states to effectively manage potential threats to water resources from hydraulic fracturing. "I am concerned that this project is politically motivated and ignores the EPA's three previous failed attempts to link hydraulic fracturing to water contamination," Pruitt wrote, calling the study "unnecessary and duplicative." "In addition the U.S. Department of Energy has investigated hydraulic fracturing's potential harm to water supplies and found no evidence linking the drilling technique to groundwater contamination," he said. Pruitt, who has railed against federal interference in what he sees as a state matter, argued that the proposed investigation "appears to be yet another attempt to transfer regulation of hydraulic fracturing from the states to the federal government." In December of 2016, the EPA released its While Oklahoma's earthquake issue is far from settled, two Stanford scientists recently published a study predicting the wastewater injection cutbacks requested by the Oklahoma Corporation Commission, coupled with the decline in commodity prices -- which has reduced the amount of new wells being drilled -- would lower the risk of another huge earthquake in Oklahoma. Industry defenders note that Oklahoma already had a broad network of fault lines and experienced two earthquakes in the 5.0 magnitude range in 1918 and 1952. But 2016 data from the US Geological Study and the Oklahoma Geological Survey noted that from 1978 to 1999, Oklahoma only had an average of 1.6 earthquakes per year with a magnitude greater than 3.0. In the Sierra Club lawsuit in federal court against four large energy producers in Oklahoma, they note that the number of annual earthquakes has increased from a maximum of 167 before 2009 to 5,838 in 2015. (The 2016 Sierra Club suit, which remains active and was filed under the Resource Conservation Recovery Act, asks for a moratorium on wastewater injection over active fault lines. At least one of the defendants has filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit.) The chance of having an earthquake of magnitude 6.0 or more in north-central Oklahoma is now above 10%, "similar to the chance of damage at high-hazard sites in California," according to the 2016 USGS report. In the next few years, the rules and regulations on hydraulic fracturing and related activities could be shaped by a wide array of federal agencies under the Trump administration, including the EPA, the Department of Interior, the Bureau of Land Management and others. Bracing for Pruitt's potential changes if he is confirmed as head of the EPA, many environmentalists believe their best avenue for challenging the administration and its allies will be through the courts. "The fact that Scott Pruitt raked in money from oil and gas companies while ignoring Oklahoma families who needed protection from fracking-induced earthquakes destroying their homes is a sneak preview for what he'd do -- or not do -- as EPA administrator," said Michael Brune, Executive Director of the Sierra Club. "Pruitt's long record of siding with polluters instead of American families and communities means he's not just unfit to serve at the EPA, he's dangerous."

"Our office has received an unprecedented volume of telephone calls, emails, and letters from members of the public related to our executive branch ethics program," he added. No date has been set for the hearing -- private or public -- yet. On Sunday, Cummings urged Congress to try to obtain documents on Trump's financial holdings. "Republicans should start doing their job under the Constitution rather than doubling-down on their retaliatory attacks against ethics officials, acting as the President-elect's personal cheerleaders, and doing back-flips to avoid doing any real oversight," Cummings said. But Chaffetz told George Stephanopoulos on ABC News' "This Week," that criticisms of Trump's conflicts plan were "premature." "The President-elect hasn't even been sworn in yet," he said.

The weather forecast for Washington, D.C. on Inauguration Day looks gray and damp. Rain will be moving in from the south and is expected to reach Washington shortly after daybreak on Friday. The chance of showers will increase throughout the morning -- from around 40% at 7 a.m. to 70 to 80% when Trump puts his hand on the Bible to take the oath of office at noon. The rain should move out of the area by time the inaugural parade begins making its way through the District's streets at 3 p.m. If you're planning to attend the inaugural festivities, bring your rain jacket or poncho, because you may need to leave your umbrellas at home. The National Park Service has revised its policy due to the rain forecast, and will allow small, collapsible "Totes" style umbrellas for the parade route and on the National Mall, but umbrellas are still prohibited for all ticketed areas on Capitol grounds (along with a bunch of other items you Though the forecast looks wet, it could be worse. Temperatures will be above average, topping out in the upper 40s. This would make Trump's inauguration the warmest since George H.W. Bush's in 1989. According to the National Weather Service in nearby Sterling, Virginia, the average historical temperature during the noon swearing-in ceremony is 37 degrees Fahrenheit, with a wind chill of 31. This year should be at least 5-10 degrees above that average. Weather has been a key part of the presidential inauguration since it was first moved outside in 1817, when President James Monroe was sworn into office. Since then we have seen extreme weather affect the festivities on many occasions. The most infamous inaugural weather occurred when President William Henry Harrison took the oath on a cold and windy March day in 1841 (presidential inaugurations were held in early March until 1937, when they were moved to January 20). Despite the cold, the new President gave a speech that lasted 1 hour and 40 minutes, and rode a horse to and from the Capitol without wearing an overcoat. Harrison caught a cold that developed into pneumonia and died one month later. The worst weather for Inauguration Day, according to the National Weather Service, occurred on March 4, 1909, during President William Howard Taft's inaugural. The ceremony had to be moved indoors as a blizzard had dumped 10 inches of snow on Washington and toppled trees and telephone poles. The parade was still held, but only after 6,000 men with 500 wagons worked through the night to clear 58,000 tons of snow from the route. President Ronald Reagan holds the unique distinction of having both the warmest and coldest January inaugurations. Reagan took his first oath outside in a mild 55 degrees, while his second swearing-in in 1985 was moved indoors as the temperature outside was only 7 degrees with a wind chill as low as minus-20. While rain is likely for this Friday, it will probably not come close to the type of washout that occurred during President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's second inauguration in 1937 -- the first to be held in January. With temperatures hovering just above freezing at 33 degrees, a cold, heavy rain poured down throughout the day -- the worst of it during the swearing-in ceremony. The rainfall total for the day reached 1.77 inches, still a record for January 20.

John McCain said Tuesday that he has not decided whether he will back Rex Tillerson for secretary of state given existing concerns about his relationship with Russia. "When I see what Vladimir Putin has done in the way of literally committing war crimes intentionally -- I'm pointing out again precision weapons used in Aleppo to strike hospitals and kill innocent men, women and children, that's just an example -- then I question the recipient of a friendship award with Vladimir Putin," the Arizona Republican told CNN's Chris Cuomo on "New Day." McCain said he is still learning more about Tillerson. "I had another conversation with him yesterday where I think he explained better to me his relations with Vladimir Putin." In 2013, Putin awarded the former ExxonMobil CEO the Order of Friendship, one of the highest honors Russia gives to foreign citizens. The honor has raised concerns that Tillerson is too close to Russia, a country many lawmakers consider one of America's biggest enemies. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said last week he was discouraged that Tillerson said he needed more information about Putin before blaming him for questionable acts, including alleged murders of political opponents and critical journalists. "Is Vladimir Putin a war criminal?" Rubio asked at Tillerson's hearing. "I would not use that term," Tillerson replied. While McCain was often critical of President Barack Obama's foreign policy -- including on Russia, he said Tuesday that Americans can be proud that they elected the current president. "He was a statement to the world that Americans will elect a person as president no matter what their color or creed is," he told Cuomo.

"Everything that he has said he's standing by," WikiLeaks quoted an Assange lawyer as saying in a tweet. Assange has lived in the Ecuadorian embassy in London where he was granted asylum in 2012 to avoid potential extradition to the United States and extradition to Sweden, where he risked prison time over accusations of sexual assault. He has denied the validity of the sexual assault claims. The exchange offer struck a puzzling note because the US has not made an extradition request for Assange. WikiLeaks also tweeted Tuesday that "Assange is confident of winning any fair trial in the US." The group celebrated Tuesday's news that President Barack Obama commuted Manning's sentence, hailing it as a "VICTORY" on Twitter. WikiLeaks followed up later with a short statement from Assange: "Thank you to everyone who campaigned for Chelsea Manning's clemency. Your courage & determination made the impossible possible." The Justice Department has not charged Assange with a crime, but US law enforcement officials have publicly acknowledged he is the subject of a criminal investigation. "(Manning) should never have been prosecuted and sentenced to decades in prison. She should be released immediately," said Barry Pollack, an attorney representing Assange, following the commutation announcement. "For many months, I have asked the DOJ to clarify Mr. Assange's status. I hope it will soon." By Tuesday evening, WikiLeaks posited that the commutation was pacifying advocates and distracting from their other criticisms of the Obama administration. "Manning's clemency stifles howls over Obama's failure to pardon Snowden, keeping civil-liberties crowd & NSA+CIA+IC onside for war v Trump," WikiLeaks tweeted. Manning was convicted in 2013 of stealing and disseminating 750,000 pages of documents and videos to WikiLeaks. The material, which WikiLeaks published in 2010, included a classified video of a US helicopter attacking civilians and journalists in Iraq in 2007. Labeled "Collateral Murder," the film drew criticism from human rights activists for the deaths of innocent people. Edward Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor who provided troves of government documents to journalists and currently resides in Moscow to avoid facing arrest and prosecution in the US, wrote to Manning, "In five more months, you will be free. Thank you for what you did for everyone, Chelsea. Stay strong a while longer!" and linked to the Guardian's story about her commutation. Snowden -- whom the White House "Since she was first taken into custody, Chelsea has been subjected to long stretches of solitary confinement -- including for attempting suicide -- and has been denied access to medically necessary health care. This move could quite literally save Chelsea's life," said Chase Strangio, an attorney for Manning in an ACLU statement. Glenn Greenwald, one of the journalists to whom Snowden leaked the NSA documents to and a supporter of Manning's release, posted the letter he wrote advocating for her clemency and said, "Chelsea Manning is probably the most empathetic person I've ever met. So thrilled!! Can't wait to see what she does." "Beyond the whistleblowing, ponder Manning's courage: she publicly announced her transition in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas," Greenwald added. An outpouring of support from other advocacy groups also came out in response to Manning's commutation. Amnesty International, Fight for the Future, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and many others rushed to celebrate Obama's decision. National security hawks, however, expressed confusion and agitation. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-Louisiana, told reporters on Capitol Hill that he considered Manning a "traitor" and said he was "disappointed" about the commutation. "If somebody leaks our state secrets, endangers Americans directly, we need to set an example that is severe and consistent," he said. Speaking with CNN's Wolf Blitzer, Sen. Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey, said, "There are very serious questions when you release the type of documents that she did, and at the end of the day, what message do we send for the next person?"

"They may agree or disagree with policy directions that he wants to take, but the people that I've interacted with, I haven't seen anyone in that community that's working against Donald Trump." Trump has accused members of the intelligence community of leaking negative information on him, comparing their actions to those of Nazi Germany. Outgoing CIA Director John Brennan hit back a Trump's comparison in an interview with The Wall Street Journal Monday, saying, "Tell the families of those 117 CIA officers who are forever memorialized on our wall of honor that their loved ones who gave their lives were akin to Nazis." Lankford added that leaks are to be expected during a time of transition.

President-elect Donald Trump has indicated that the trade restrictions imposed after Russia's annexation of Crimea could be eased in return for a deal on weapons. In a press conference in Moscow on Tuesday, Lavrov said he was aware of Trump's comments, which were reported in "I did not see the proposal to disarm combined with the sanctions, but if we speak about nuclear weapons and strategic stability and strategic parity -- this is exclusive between Russia and the United States and we understand that the elected president, the president of Russia, referred to the nuclear arsenals, I am convinced that for both us, one of the priorities and tasks would be to renew dialogue on strategic stability, which like everything else, was destroyed by the Obama administration," Lavrov said. Lavrov welcomed Trump's approach to foreign policy. "If we look at Donald Trump's foreign policy, the most important will be the fight against terrorism," he said. "We welcome that," he continued, noting that in the second term of President Obama's administration, "our relations [with the US] were not friendly." The US and European Union both imposed sanctions on Russia after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 -- those sanctions were extended for a Trump suggested during the joint interview that they could be eased in return for a nuclear weapons deal.

The policy, written by the Department of Education, is under review by the White House budget office and has drawn fierce opposition from Republican lawmakers and school administrators. It was first proposed in September, but the department appears to have rushed to adopt it since Donald Trump won the presidential election. Adopting the regulation before Friday at noon would bind the incoming Trump administration unless Congress overturns it. Republicans on Capitol Hill have pledged to oppose many "midnight regulations" from the Obama White House, and the issue could also come up at the nomination hearing Tuesday for Donald Trump's secretary of education, Betsy DeVos. The regulation would dramatically increase federal control over spending at many of the nation's 14,000 school districts and force some districts to increase spending at low-income schools. Districts could achieve the increase by diverting money -- a total of $800 million nationwide -- from more-affluent schools, or by spending an additional $2.2 billion in state and local funds, the Education Department says. The regulation would apply only to school districts that have both low-income schools that get Title I federal funds and higher-income schools that are not eligible for the money. "If this were to be finalized, it would be a huge deal because it's saying how local and state money inside school districts is to be distributed across schools," said Nora Gordon, a school-finance expert at Georgetown University. Scott Sargrad, a former Education Department official, said the regulation "could significantly improve achievement for students" in low-income schools. "This is the federal government explicitly saying poor students need to have at least the same resources as their higher-income counterparts. That's a significant step for the federal government to say that," said Sargrad, who is now an education policy expert at Center for American Progress, a liberal Washington think tank. But opponents including Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tennessee, say federal law does not give the administration the authority to enact such a far-reaching regulation. Alexander, chairman of the Senate education committee and a former secretary of education, has vowed to block the regulation -- a move that would require a majority vote in both houses of Congress and the President's signature. Congress could also effectively stymie the regulation by denying the department funding to implement it. The National School Boards Association called the regulation "unnecessary" and "unwarranted federal overreach" that would constrain school districts. After accepting public comments for 60 days, until early November, the department took just four weeks to send a final version of the regulation to the White House budget office for review. Departments and agencies typically take at least several months -- and sometimes years -- to write a final rule after receiving public comments. "They've been pushing this rule pretty hard," said Nat Malkus, an education-policy expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. The budget office has given no indication of when and if it will approve the regulation. The Education Department has not released its final version, although experts expect it will closely resemble the initial proposal. Department spokeswoman Dorie Nolt would say only that the agency "is still working on the final rule." Education Secretary John B. King Jr. has championed the regulation as a way of improving education for low-income students by requiring school districts spend the same amount of state and local dollars at their low-income schools as they do at higher-income schools. An Education Department study in 2011 found many low-income schools were receiving less in per-pupil funding than their higher-income counterparts in the same district. The department says that 3.3 million of the nation's 50 million public-school students attend low-income schools that receive less money per pupil than higher-income schools in the same district. As a result, the department says, nearly 6,000 low-income schools "are shortchanged by about $440,000 a year." In announcing the proposal in August, King called it "an important step forward to advancing resource equity across the country." King also urged districts and states to comply with the regulation "by providing additional funds for education focused on high-needs schools, not by shifting dollars around or forcing transfers of teachers or other personnel." The regulation interprets a small section of a 400-page education law enacted in December 2015 whose main goal is to increase local control over education standards, school curriculums and standardized testing. The law was sponsored by Sen. Alexander and received broad bipartisan support. It reverses parts of the No Child Left Behind Act, and requires, for example, that states consider more than just test scores in evaluating schools. The section of the 2015 act currently in question concerns the longstanding policy that requires school districts to use Title I education funds only to supplement state and local funding and not in place of those funds. Until now, the policy has stopped short of requiring school districts to spend the same money per pupil in Title I schools and in non-Title I schools. The Education Department has said that 90 percent of the nation's school districts do not have substantial funding disparities between low-income and high-income schools, and would not need to adjust funding. But Gordon, the Georgetown expert, said the new rule would affect even those school districts that do not need to make immediate funding changes. "Anything they're thinking about doing, like opening a special arts program in a school, they would need to make sure they're still in compliance," Gordon said. "It really could inhibit innovation in districts because they'd worry about falling out of compliance."

Premiums, which would rise by up to 25% initially, would double by 2026. Though the bill the CBO studied is no longer in play, the findings lay out the daunting challenge Republicans and President-elect Donald Trump have ahead as they seek to fulfill their promise to swiftly repeal the Affordable Care Act. A growing chorus of lawmakers and health care industry experts have demanded to see leaders' replacement plans before The report, prepared at the request of Democratic congressional leaders, looked at the 2015 Republican legislation that repealed Obamacare's coverage mandates, taxes, subsidies and Medicaid expansion, but did not include replacement plan. That bill was vetoed by President Barack Obama. Democrats quickly jumped on the report, saying the GOP plan will hurt Americans and raise health care costs. "The numbers are even worse than experts could have imagined: tens of millions will lose their health insurance, and individuals will see their premiums double," said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Republicans said the "This report assumes a situation that simply doesn't exist and that no one in Congress advocates," said David Popp, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. "And after years of devastating news about the consequences of Obamacare, I can see why Democrats would want to change the subject," Popp added. "But Democrats face a choice now: Do they agree with their Leader and refuse to work together on any reforms at all? Or do they agree with us that doing nothing is not an option, and work with us on a series of step-by-step reforms to prevent the scenario envisioned by the CBO report." House Speaker Paul Ryan also blasted the report. "This projection is meaningless, as it takes into account no measures to replace the law nor actions that the incoming administration will take to revitalize the individual market that has been decimated by Obamacare," said AshLee Strong, Ryan's spokeswoman. Republicans have been struggling to unify around a repeal and replacement plan, even as they have already kicked off the process of dismantling President Obama's landmark health reform law. The House on Friday followed the Senate in approving a budget resolution that would repeal major portions of the Affordable Care Act. Committees in both chambers will now work out the details of repealing and replacing the law. ©President Barack Obama on Tuesday reduced or eliminated the sentences for hundreds more non-violent drug offenders. The move brings Obama well beyond his most recent predecessors, who used their commutation powers more sparingly. He's now reduced sentences for 1,385 individuals, the vast majority of whom are serving time for crimes related to distribution or production of narcotics. Many of those whose punishments he's reduced were incarcerated for crimes involving crack cocaine, which came with mandatory sentences that were longer than those for the powdered version of the drug. The discrepancy -- a facet of a decades-long war on drugs -- overwhelmingly affected African-Americans. Obama had hoped for legislation to permanently end the disparities in sentencing laws. While an unlikely group of activists have pushed in Congress for a bill that would alter mandatory minimums and reform the prison system, a rancorous political climate during last year's presidential campaign prevented progress. Instead, Obama encouraged Americans serving lengthy terms to apply for clemency, prompting a flood of applications to his Justice Department. A group of legal aid groups established the Clemency Project to help screen applicants and complete the required paperwork. An onslaught of requests required Obama's aides to establish a process for vetting applications, which began backing up in the Pardon Attorney's office. At the beginning of 2017, 13,568 petitions for clemency were still pending. The Obama administration has received more than 30,000 petitions over eight years. The power to grant pardons and commutations is written into the US constitution as one of the president's clearest unilateral prerogatives. With large batches often coming in the final weeks of an administration, an act of clemency cannot be challenged in court or overturned by Congress. President George W. Bush granted 189 pardons and 11 commutations, including reducing the prison term for I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby, convicted of perjury, obstruction of justice and lying to investigators in the probe of the leak of the name of a CIA operative. President Bill Clinton issued a flurry of pardons on his final day in office, including for financier Marc Rich and the president's half-brother Roger Clinton. In sum, Clinton ordered 396 pardons and 61 commutations. No recent commander-in-chief, however, has used the powers as liberally as Obama to enact a criminal justice reform agenda. Writing in the Harvard Law Review earlier this month, Obama said his push toward eliminating mandatory minimum sentences and offering clemency to non-violent drug offenders was informed by his own history. "This is an effort that has touched me personally, and not just because I could have been caught up in the system myself had I not gotten some breaks as a kid," Obama wrote, recalling meetings at the White House with recipients of his clemency grants who had turned their life around. "By shifting the narrative to the way clemency can be used to correct injustices in the system -- and reminding people of the value of second chances -- I worked to reinvigorate the clemency power and to set a precedent that will make it easier for future presidents, governors and other public officials to use it for good," Obama wrote. While President-elect Donald Trump has yet to detail his planned use of clemency powers, there's little optimism about criminal justice reform advocates that he'll continue Obama's efforts. Trump ran on a "law and order" platform, though rarely addressed issues of clemency or sentencing on the campaign trail. "I'm looking at various predictors to try and decide where he might go. He wants to make America safe again. We know based on data that locking up low-level offenders won't make America safe," said Jessica Jackson Sloan, the national director and co-founder of #cut50, a group committed to reducing the US prison population by half.

Earnest, whom the President first met in Iowa ahead of his unlikely victory in the 2008 caucuses, stood by as his boss praised their decade-long partnership. "I've watched him grow and I've watched him advance, and I've watched him marry and I've watched him be a father and I've watched him manage younger people coming up behind him," Obama said. "And he's never disappointed. He has always been the guy you wanted him to be." Tuesday's briefing was the latest in a long string of final events for the Obama administration, which officially concludes at noon on Friday. Obama's staff has been departing in waves since the beginning of the month. Those remaining are packing their final belongings in preparation for vacating their offices for President-elect Donald Trump and his team. Obama holds his final news conference on Wednesday. Trump's team moves into their offices shortly after the incoming Republican President takes the oath of office at noon Friday. Members of Trump's incoming administration have raised the prospect of altering how press briefings will proceed under the new administration including moving the briefings to a larger room. Several of Obama's staffers squeezed into the briefing room to watch the President's appearance. Obama on Tuesday praised Earnest's attributes that he said made him an effective press secretary: preparation, courtesy, honesty and a willingness to share as much of the President's vision as he could. He also said Earnest's "all-American, matinee, good-looking thing" helped, along with his descriptive surname. "The guy's name is Josh Earnest. Which, if somebody is speaking on your behalf, is a pretty good name to have," he said. "The guy's name is Josh Earnest.

Movers were spotted Tuesday afternoon pulling boxes out of an unmarked white truck at the site of the first family's post-White House digs in Washington's Kalorama neighborhood. Contents included dozens of tall wardrobe boxes and neatly-organized crates with labels. "School supplies," "framed photos for the living room," "dog supplies," "his bathroom" and even "cleaning supplies, box 5," were some of the labels visible on the boxes. A team of several movers worked quickly through at-times heavy rain. Three sets of golf clubs were carried into the Tudor home, as well as one large wardrobe rack filled with colorful dresses. When one emptied truck pulled away, another took its place and the unloading continued. The Obamas are leasing the 8,200-square-foot home, which was built in 1928 and has nine bedrooms. Before they officially settle in, the future ex-President is headed for some R&R. He will take his final flight aboard the plane that is currently Air Force One to Palm Springs, California, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Tuesday.

These options would inherently increase the risk for US troops compared to what President Barack Obama was willing to accept. The options will be ready for President-elect Donald Trump to consider as soon as he takes office and would be presented by James Mattis as the new defense secretary and Gen. Joe Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. They would have the final say on any details being briefed to the new president for his approval. Options to deal with other hotspots, including Iran, are also being prepared, according to the defense official. The options had already been worked up by the military during the Obama administration, but the authorities to carry them out were never approved by President Barack Obama. New authorizations by Trump, needed to act on any of the proposals, would mean the US is expanding both its military strategy on fighting ISIS and signal the Trump White House is willing to take on increased military risk. None of the options being discussed contradict positions taken by Mattis publicly at this point. Discussing ISIS on the campaign trail, Trump pledged to "bomb the s--t out of them." And in September, he said, "I am also going to convene my top generals and give them a simple instruction: They will have 30 days to submit to the Oval Office a plan for defeating ISIS." US military planners and intelligence officials have now mapped virtually every airstrip and location in Syria that might have to be used by US troops, according to the official directly familiar with the details. One option would put hundreds, if not thousands, of additional US troops into a combat role as part of the fight to take Raqqa. Depending on progress in arming and training the full Syrian Democratic Forces -- a local fighting force -- in the coming months, the Pentagon could put several US brigade-sized combat teams on the ground, each team perhaps as many as 4,000 troops. There is no consensus on the size of any US deployment being proposed, because a final decision on how many to send would depend on what is done with issues like arming the Kurds, who are also US partners in the fight. The US troops would not enter Raqqa but would focus on territory outside the city, calling in airstrikes and controlling roads and towns around Raqqa. In addition, heavily armed US Special Operations Forces could be put in a direct combat role for the first time, beyond their current mission to advise and assist local forces. Another key option is for Trump to authorize the Pentagon for the first time to arm Kurdish fighters, who would be used to control villages and roads around Raqqa. The move would be highly controversial because it would surely anger Turkey -- a NATO ally -- which does not want to see Kurdish elements gain further military strength, the official said. But the Pentagon believes that the Kurds and Arabs who make up the Syrian Democratic Forces are the only local fighters able to take the ground around Raqqa, ISIS's self-declared capital and its most important stronghold in the country. Arab elements of the SDF are the ones who would eventually enter Raqqa, a predominantly Arab town. Currently, the SDF has about 50,000 fighters. The Kurdish YPG portion of the SDF is about 27,000, though it includes some Arabs. The Syrian Arab Coalition portion of the SDV has 23,000 forces, with some Kurds in the mix. Trump will be briefed on efforts to capture or kill ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. There have been multiple intelligence tips in recent weeks about Baghdadi's whereabouts, the official said. But none of them have been "real-time" sightings, only tips on where he had recently been seen. Military and intelligence officials are now working through that data to narrow down a possible location. A recent mission by the US Expeditionary Targeting Force outside Deir Ezzor was specifically aimed at capturing an ISIS operative who was believed to have intelligence on Baghdadi, but the person opened fire on the American troops, who then killed him. Another set of options aims to counter Iran's growing influence in the region, something Mattis has already indicated is one of his top priorities. US military commanders would like more authority to stop Iranian weapons shipments into Yemen through the Bab al-Mandab waterway between Yemen and the Horn of Africa, the official said. This authority could extend to trying to stop the buildup of shore installations along the Yemen coast using Iranian-supplied weapons to attack shipping and US military vessels transiting through the area. In October, the US conducted missile strikes against coastal installations being run by Iranian-supported fighters to attack US Navy ships. Additional options are being updated to ensure the Strait of Hormuz cannot be shut down by Iran. One area of increased US military activity in the coming days that Trump has not yet had a role in is Afghanistan. Within days, Afghan forces -- with support from US air and ground units -- will launch a series of operations in southern and eastern Afghanistan against the Taliban. These are likely to be the first intensified military operations of the Trump administration but have been long planned by the Pentagon, the official said.

But the partisan agreement ends there. Majorities say that if the assessment were to prove true, these attempts would be a crisis or major problem for the US (65% say so), and that the outcome of the election would have been the same regardless of the information released (58% say that). Further, 56% say that despite this situation, the US ought to continue its efforts to improve relations with Russia rather than take strong economic and diplomatic steps against Russia. But there is less agreement on whether the intelligence community's conclusions are correct. About 43% say it is extremely or very likely that the intelligence community's assessment is correct, with another 32% saying that is somewhat likely. About one-quarter, 24%, say it's unlikely to be true. Democrats are more likely to think the intelligence community's assessment is correct: 74% of Democrats see that as very or extremely likely, compared with 17% of Republicans. And partisanship colors views on how big a problem Russian attempts to influence US elections are. Among Democrats, 84% consider it a crisis or major problem compared with just 37% of Republicans. Democrats are also more likely than Republicans to say that information was significant enough to change the result of the election (65% say so vs. just 10% of Republicans). Among independents, 65% say that if the intelligence community is correct it would be a major problem for the country, but they tend to doubt that it is true, with just 37% saying it's very likely to be correct and 38% that it could have changed the outcome of the election. The public is split overall and along partisan lines on whether President-elect Donald Trump will be tough enough on Russia after he's taken the oath of office Friday, with 47% thinking he'll be too easy on them, and 43% saying he'll be about right. Another 8% think he will be too tough toward Russia. Among Democrats, 75% say he'll be too easy, while 80% of Republicans say his approach will be about right. There's a far narrower -- though seemingly meaningful -- partisan divide in opinions on Russian President Vladimir Putin. Overall, just 12% have a favorable view of Putin, among the lowest ratings found among the 11 world leaders tested in the poll. While 71% overall and majorities across party lines express a negative read on Putin, 23% of Republicans have a favorable view compared with 11% of independents and 4% of Democrats. In December 2014, there was no partisan split in impressions of Putin, with 11% of Democrats, 11% of Republicans and 10% of independents saying they saw him positively.

They included claims that Russia had video evidence of Trump with prostitutes at a hotel in Moscow when he was in the city for the Miss Universe pageant in 2013. "These things that have been alleged are clearly false information," Putin said during the joint news conference with the Moldovan president. "It is true that when (Trump) came to Moscow -- I don't remember when, a few years ago -- he was not a political actor. We did not know about his political ambitions. He was just a businessman, one of the rich people of America. What do you think -- we have special security services running after every American billionaire? Of course not. It is complete rubbish," Putin added. Putin joked about the allegations before vigorously defending Trump and attacking those who prepared and published the dossier: "Did Trump really come and meet with Moscow prostitutes? Firstly he is an adult, and secondly he is a person who for many years has organized a beauty pageant, socialized with the most beautiful women in the world. It is hard to believe that he ran to a hotel to meet with our girls of a low social class, although they are the best in the world," Putin said. "But finally, you know, what I want to say, prostitution is a serious, ugly, social phenomenon, young women do this connected to the fact that they cannot survive any other way and that is a problem of society but people who order false information and spread this information against the elected President, who fabricate it and use it in a political fight, they are worse than prostitutes," he added. The Russian leader also said he had never met the President-elect. "I don't know what he will be doing on the international stage. So I have no foundation to criticize him nor to defend him," Putin added. The accusations against Russian security officials were presented in a two-page synopsis, appended to a report on alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election. The allegations came, in part, from memos compiled by the former British intelligence operative, whose past work US intelligence officials consider credible. The FBI is investigating the credibility and accuracy of these allegations, which are based primarily on information from Russian sources, but has not confirmed many essential details in the memos about Trump. Trump dismissed the allegations as "fake news" at a news conference last week.

Illinois Democrat Sen. Tammy Duckworth, a combat veteran, asked Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke a series of questions about his views on sexual assault -- referencing specifically comments made by Trump. She cited a 2013 Trump tweet Duckworth asked Zinke, a former Navy SEAL, how he would tackle problems of sexual harassment within the National Parks Service, where men and women serve in sometimes remote and rugged locations. "I take issues of sexual assault ... absolutely seriously," Zinke said, saying there is "zero" tolerance in the military. He said that needs to be true in the Parks Service, as well. "They have to know from leadership from the top to the bottom that we have zero tolerance," he said. Duckworth, who previously served in the House alongside Zinke, pressed over his introduction of a bill that would have women register for the draft, a policy he does not support. She called the move a "gimmick." "I think it's important for America to have that discussion ... I don't think it's a 'gimmick' to have that discussion about whether women should be in the selective service," he responded. Later, Zinke committed to Michigan Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow that he would study the issue of sexual harassment in the Parks Service. "You do have my commitment, I take it very, very seriously," Zinke said. "(Everyone) should absolutely have the right expectation of a work environment that is conducive to success. And if there is a culture of sexual harassment, that is flat wrong. And I'm going to stamp it out if confirmed." "You do have my commitment, I take it very, very seriously," Zinke said.

And I'm going to stamp it out if confirmed." ©President-elect Donald Trump's nominee to lead the Interior Department pledged Tuesday to review Obama administration actions limiting oil and gas drilling in Alaska and said he does not believe climate change is a hoax. Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke appeared before Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee as the Senate heads into a second week of intense confirmation hearings after a long holiday weekend. Zinke said it's "indisputable" that the climate is changing. "I do not believe it's a 'hoax," Zinke said in a response to a question from Sen. Bernie Sanders, a contrast with a past statement from Trump using that word. "Man has had an influence" on climate, Zinke said, "I think that's indisputable as well." But Zinke demurred when it came to committing to address rising temperatures or limiting oil drilling on public lands. "I think where there's debate is what that influence is and what we can do about it," he said. "I will inherit USGS. There's great scientists there. Zinke pledged to base his actions on and support "objective science." Committee Chairwoman Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska, earlier asked Zinke for his commitment to reviewing all of the Obama administration's moves to put parts of her state off limits to development. Zinke said he would. "The President-elect has said we want to be energy independent," Zinke said, saying he had traveled in his military career and witnessed the impacts of energy policy. "It is better to produce energy domestically with reasonable regulation than have it produced overseas without regulation." On one of the most important issues to both members of the committee, Zinke ruled out pursuing the sale or transfer of federal lands -- something that pleases Democrats on the panel. "I want to be clear on this point. I am absolutely against transfer or sale of public lands," he told Sanders in response to another question. Zinke also said one of his top three priorities would be the backlog of needed maintenance on national parks and federal lands, with a nod to one of Trump's stated goals of investing in infrastructure. The Montana Republican said he would "prioritize" an estimate of $12.5 billion in a backlog of National Parks maintenance and repair. "The President-elect is committed to a jobs and infrastructure bill, and I am committed and to need your help in making sure that bill includes our Nations treasures," Zinke said in his opening. Asked further about the issue, Zinke listed off just the projects he sees on a regular basis in the DC area, including fountains that don't work and the Arlington Memorial Bridge in grave need of repair. "We better get on it," Zinke said. Zinke was also asked about the hot topic of national monuments. In the waning months of his administration, President Barack Obama angered Republicans by designating millions of acres of land as national monuments. The move pleased conservationists and Native American tribes that viewed some of the sites as sacred, but aggravated local politicians and communities around the land. Multiple senators asked Zinke about whether the President-elect might rescind the monument designation -- something that has never been done. Zinke would not commit to doing so, but would not rule it out. "It will be interesting to see if the President has authority to nullify a monument," Zinke said. "Legally, it's untested. ... I think if a President would nullify a monument it would be challenged, and then a judge would determine (legality)." But going forward, Zinke said his priority would be working with states and local communities ahead of time to get people on board with monuments. "A monument, when it falls in a state, I think the state should have a say," Zinke said. "I view it as absolutely critical to have state and local support on a monument that they participate in." Like his predecessors, Zinke committed to traveling across the country and visiting states -- but especially pledged to visit Utah, where one of Obama's controversial monument designations was established. Zinke is a decorated former Navy SEAL, serving 23 years, and former state senator. He is in his second term in Congress, being elected for the first time in 2014. His selection as the Interior nominee was due in part to his views as a Western state lawmaker and on public lands. Trump's son, Donald Trump Jr., is an avid hunter and fisher and subscriber to a Teddy Roosevelt view of public lands that mixes conservation and development. Zinke often cites himself as a Roosevelt acolyte, as well. Trump Jr. was actively involved in the search for an interior nominee, speaking openly with sportsmen publications about his interest in the role. "I am an unapologetic admirer of Teddy Roosevelt and believe he had it right when he placed under federal protection millions of acres of our ©Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday it was up to each individual senator to decide whether to attend President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration this week -- leaving the door open to potentially more Democratic protest. Schumer told CNN's Manu Raju that he "respects" the almost four dozen House Democrats who have said they are boycotting Trump's inauguration and did not say that anyone is obligated to attend. "I respect where they're coming from. There have been so many irregularities in this, especially with Russian interference, so I respect where they're coming from," Schumer said. "I think each person has to make the choice on their own, but I don't begrudge those who have said they're boycotting. Each person can make his or her own decision." No Senate Democrats have yet to say definitively they will boycott the inauguration -- but pressure has been mounting from the left, particularly in light of Trump's continuing feud with civil rights icon and Georgia Rep. John Lewis. ©More than a million supporters of Edward Snowden have petitioned President Barack Obama to pardon him, but the former National Security Agency contractor hasn't submitted the required documents for clemency, according to the White House. "Mr. Snowden has not filed paperwork to seek clemency from this administration," White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said on Tuesday. Snowden has remained in Russia since 2013, when he provided details of previously unknown domestic and international US surveillance programs to media outlets. A number of high-profile human-rights groups have publicly requested Obama issue some type of clemency for Snowden, including the American Civil Liberties Union, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. They've argued that doing so would help other whistleblowers come forward with perceived government wrongdoing. The White House has said consistently that Snowden's disclosures harmed national security, and insisted that returning to the United States for trail would be a necessary precursor to any pardon. Speaking in November, Obama all but ruled out a pardon for Snowden, arguing he hadn't lived up to the requirements necessary for such an act of clemency. "I can't pardon somebody who hasn't gone before a court and presented themselves, so that's not something that I would comment on at this point," Obama told the German newspaper Der Spiegel. "At the point at which Mr. Snowden wants to present himself before the legal authorities and make his arguments or have his lawyers make his arguments, then I think those issues come into play," Obama said. "Until that time, what I've tried to suggest -- both to the American people, but also to the world -- is that we do have to balance this issue of privacy and security." Snowden wrote this month that if Obama were to issue pardons for leakers of US intelligence, he should grant clemency for Chelsea Manning, an Army private who provided sensitive documents to WikiLeaks.

What's clear three days before Trump takes the oath is that it will take some time for all of them to reach a consensus on his key priorities -- if they ever do. For instance, Trump wants an Obamacare replacement in place right away, and he's not a fan of House Speaker Paul Ryan's "border adjustment tax." Details, details ...

FRIDAY -- TRUMP INAUGURATION!! -- Trump may sign some executive orders on the first day, but word from the transition team is Monday will be a much busier day on that front. ©Donald Trump will become president Friday with an approval rating of just 40%, Following a tumultuous transition period, approval ratings for Trump's handling of the transition are more than 20 points below those for any of his three most recent predecessors. Obama took the oath in 2009 with an 84% approval rating, 67% approved of Clinton's transition as of late December 1992 and 61% approved of George W. Bush's transition just before he took office in January 2001. Trump's wobbly handling of the presidential transition has left most Americans with growing doubts that the President-elect will be able to handle the job. About 53% say Trump's statements and actions since Election Day have made them less confident in his ability to handle the presidency, and the public is split evenly on whether Trump will be a good or poor president (48% on each side). The President-elect dismissed the poll findings Rep. Sean Duffy, a Trump supporter, said the President-elect's ongoing battle with the media has hurt his image. "What's happening here is the public fight that Mr. Trump is having with CNN and other media groups has taken some skin off his poll numbers and it's gone down," he told CNN's Chris Cuomo Tuesday on "New Day." Across all three of these measures, Americans' impressions of Trump have worsened since November. In that time, disapproval of his handling of the transition has climbed seven points to 52%, the percentage who think he'll do a good job has dropped five points, and the share saying they have lost confidence in Trump's ability to be president grew 10 points. Trump's favorability rating, a measure often seen as a read on a public figure's personality rather than the job he or she is doing, has taken less of a hit, decreasing by just 3 points to 44%. That change falls within the poll's margin of sampling error and is not statistically significant. Despite these declines, many Americans remain confident that Trump will achieve several signature campaign promises, with most saying it's at least somewhat likely that he will impose tariffs on companies that manufacture goods in Mexico (71%), renegotiate NAFTA (61%) and create good-paying jobs in economically challenged areas (61%). About half think Trump will be able to simplify the tax code (50%) or protect sensitive electronic information from theft by foreign governments (48%). Fewer, 44%, say it's likely that Trump will be able to build a wall along the border with Mexico, and just 29% believe he will be able to get Mexico to reimburse the United States for the construction of the wall. About 4-in-10 think the President-elect will be able to defeat ISIS, down from 50% who said so in November. More broadly, less than half say Trump's priorities for the country reflect their own (46% say so), and the country is almost evenly divided on whether the policies he's proposed will move the country in the right direction or the wrong one (48% right direction, 49% wrong direction). The poll suggests the deep political divisions that drove the 2016 presidential campaign -- between men and women, whites and racial minorities, those holding college degrees and those without and rural residents and those in more urban areas -- continue unabated as Inauguration Day approaches. Trump's approval rating for handling the transition is almost 30 points higher among rural residents than it is among urbanites, nearly 20 points higher among men than women and among whites than non-whites, and 13 points higher among whites without degrees than among those who completed college. The incoming vice president, Mike Pence, holds a narrowly net-positive favorability rating, 40% favorable to 37% unfavorable. Republicans rate Pence slightly lower than his new boss, 75% have a favorable view of the VP-to-be while 89% have a positive take on Trump. Among Democrats, however, Pence earns higher marks than Trump, 16% see him favorably vs. 9% who say so about Trump. Opinions on Melania Trump are mixed, with a sizable share still unsure how they feel about the incoming first lady (36% favorable, 35% unfavorable, 28% unsure). And after a campaign in which she largely remained off the trail, most say they expect her to take on a mostly private role as first lady rather than a public one. About two-thirds (67%) say they see her remaining more in the background and focusing on her role as a mother and wife than being an advocate for issues and causes and hosting White House functions. Trump's daughter, Ivanka, who is moving to Washington, heads into her role in the first family with more goodwill than her father or the future first lady. Overall, 44% have a favorable impression of her, 33% unfavorable, with 23% saying they're unsure.

These foods are all on the menu for the inaugural luncheon, a long-standing tradition in which the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies hosts a meal for the president and vice president at the Capitol following the inaugural address. The committee organized its first luncheon in 1953, when lawmakers welcomed President Dwight Eisenhower for creamed chicken, baked ham and potato puffs in the Capitol's Old Senate Chamber. Dishes, consumed between toasts, gift presentations and speeches, often encompass foods from the home states of the new leaders, though Trump's menu owes heavily to California, not his home state of New York or Vice President-elect Mike Pence's state of Indiana. President Barack Obama's 2013 luncheon boasted a menu of steamed lobster, grilled bison and apple pie. Trump's, which will be held in the Statuary Hall, will feature three courses. The first, Maine lobster and Gulf shrimp with saffron sauce and peanut crumble, will be accompanied by a J. Lohr 2013 Arroyo Vista Chardonnay. The Gulf shrimp may be a tribute to Florida, where Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort is located and which the President-elect has called his "second home." This will be followed by grilled Seven Hills Angus beef in dark chocolate and juniper jus with potato gratin, served alongside Delicato Black Stallion 2012 Limited Release Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon.

Aside from former staffers, Obama appointed multiple athletes to the President's Council on Fitness, Sports and Nutrition, including gymnast Gabrielle Douglas, Soccer star Carli Lloyd and retired basketball player Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Sen. Angus King was also appointed as a member of the Roosevelt Campobello International Park Commission. None of the appointments made by Obama Tuesday require Senate confirmation.

The classified documents presented last week to President Barack Obama and President-elect Trump included unsubstantiated allegations that Russian operatives claimed to have compromising personal and financial information about Trump, multiple US officials with direct knowledge of the briefings told CNN. The allegations came, in part, from memos compiled by a former British intelligence operative, whose past work US intelligence officials consider credible. Woodward made headlines over the weekend when he told "FOX News Sunday" that the dossier of unsubstantiated findings by the former British operative was a "garbage document." Asked by CNN's Alisyn Camerota to explain his position, Woodward said, "I have read those 35 pages, and the quality is not good." He said the intelligence community "tainted the good report they had on Russian hacking by including this, and they shouldn't have done that." Woodward was joined for the interview by fellow award-winning Watergate scandal reporter, Carl Bernstein, a CNN Political contributor who co-bylined the original CNN report on the documents. During the "New Day" interview, Woodward said of the CNN report, "I thought it was done in a very restrained, accurate way, and the CNN story said, look, we can't substantiate any of this so we are not going to publish the details from it."

Elizabeth Warren repeatedly questioned Donald Trump's education secretary nominee Betsy DeVos on Tuesday over her commitment to protecting taxpayers from student loan abuse. But the Massachusetts Democrat isn't convinced she got the answers she wanted. "As Education Secretary, Betsy DeVos would be in charge of running a $1 trillion student loan bank. She has no experience doing that," the Massachusetts Democrat wrote Tuesday on her Facebook page following Devos' testimony to the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. "In fact, Betsy DeVos has no experience with student loans, Pell Grants, or public education at all." "If Betsy DeVos can't commit to using the Department of Education's many tools and resources to protect students from fraud, I don't see how she can be the Secretary of Education," Warren added. Warren, a progressive who has railed against big banks and student loan debt, told DeVos that she would be responsible for managing student loans and issuing Pell Grants. "The financial futures of an entire generation of young people depends on your department getting that right," she said. "Mrs. DeVos, do you have any direct experience running a bank?" DeVos said she did not. She also said that she had no experience managing loan programs. Warren then proceeded to ask DeVos, who grew up in a wealthy family, about her experience funding her college education. "For you to understand what it is like for students and families who are struggling to pay for college, have you ever taken out a student loan from the federal government," the senator asked. DeVos said that she has not and neither have her children. But DeVos said she was not completely unfamiliar with Pell Grants and has friends and students with whom she worked who have first hand experience with the program. Warren asked DeVos if she would protect taxpayers from fraud abuse. "Now we all know President Trump's experience with higher education was to create a fake university, which resulted in him paying $125 million to students that he cheated," said Warren, who supported Hillary Clinton's presidential bid. "How do you plan to protect taxpayer dollars from waste, fraud and abuse from colleges and taking millions of dollars and student aid?" "Senator, if confirmed I will certainly be very vigilant," DeVos said. "The individuals with whom I worked will ensure that federal monies are used properly and appropriately. I will look forward ..." Warren interrupted DeVos asking about more responsibility and details. "You are going to subcontract making sure that what happens with universities that cheat students doesn't happen anymore," the senator asked. "You will give that to someone else to do? I want to know what your ideas are." "I want to make sure we don't have problems with that as well. If confirmed, I will work diligently to confirm we are addressing any of those issues," DeVos replied. "I want to make sure we don't have problems with that as well. If confirmed, I will work diligently to confirm we are addressing any of those issues," DeVos replied. ©Betsy DeVos, President-elect Donald Trump's pick to lead the Education Department, is seeking to dismiss questions about donations to Focus on the Family from a foundation tied to her. She said at her confirmation hearing Tuesday that a "clerical error" led to her being listed as an officer of her mother's multi-million-dollar foundation, which made the donations. That error, however, dates back as early as 1999, when the Edgar & Elsa Prince Foundation filed its 1998 federal tax returns, according to IRS documents obtained by CNN. Edgar and Elsa Price are Betsy DeVos' parents. DeVos was listed as a vice president of the charity for 17 consecutive years, including most recently in the organization's 2014 tax filing. When pressed by Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire about the discrepancy during her confirmation hearing, DeVos said her appearing in tax filing was a "clerical error." "I can assure you, I have never made decisions on my mother's behalf on the foundation board," DeVos said, adding later that it is "incorrect" that she was ever in leadership on her mother's firm. On Wednesday, when presented with the 17 years of tax documents, Hassan said DeVos blaming a "clerical error" was "concerning, to say the least." "It is hard to believe that Mrs. DeVos could be listed as vice president of the Prince Foundation ... and yet have no involvement with, or knowledge of, the millions of dollars in donations made to anti-LGBTQ groups that promote intolerance," Hassan said in an email to CNN. "For Mrs. DeVos to try to explain away these donations by claiming that her title was simply a 'clerical error' is concerning, to say the least." DeVos "is not now -- nor has ever been -- an officer nor director of the foundation in question," a Trump spokesperson said in response to Hassan. "When she became aware that the foundation was reporting her erroneously in that capacity, she requested an immediate restatement of filings. That has been taken care of," the spokesperson said. Michigan state records show a "certificate of correction" was filed Tuesday -- the day after the issue surfaced in DeVos' confirmation hearing -- for the charity's 2006 and 2015 annual reports requesting the corporate records by amended to remove DeVos' name from the list of directors. DeVos is a woman who stands between two wealthy and powerful conservative families who have given considerable money to conservative organizations, Republican lawmakers and presidential candidates. Multiple Democratic senators pushed DeVos Tuesday for her connection to Focus on the Family, a conservative non-profit that, among other things, has pushed the benefits of conversion therapy for LGBT men and women. "I have never believed in that," DeVos said, noting that she embraces equality and asked senators to not conflate her political donations and those from "other families members beyond my core family." But her family has given millions to the organization. According to watchdog groups, DeVos' personal foundation and the Edgar & Elsa Prince Foundation have given at least $5 million to Focus on the Family. The The ©The superintendent for a rural Wyoming school Ray Schulte, superintendent for Park County School District No. 6, told CNN Wednesday he was at the school board meeting Tuesday night when he got word one of their local school had been mentioned by DeVos. "I noticed the gal mentioned Wapiti School," he said. Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, who represents Sandy Hook, the site of the 2012 school shooting, had asked DeVos if she believed guns have "any place in and around schools." "I think that is best left to locales and states to decide," she said. After Murphy pushed DeVos, she brought up a story Wyoming Sen. Mike Enzi told about a school with has fences around it to protect against grizzly bears. "I will refer back to Sen. Enzi and the school he is talking about in Wyoming. I think probably there, I would imagine there is probably a gun in a school to protect from potential grizzlies," she said. Schulte said it's against state law to have guns at school. "We do not allow weapons on school property," he said. But Schulte said they do have two schools with 10-foot mesh fences to ward off large animals. "They put up a wildlife fence about 10-15 years ago," he said, adding there are cougar and grizzly in the area. Wapiti School has 10 students and is located about 25 miles outside of Yellowstone National Park. "There's a lot of bear out there. I talked to people who go out and see five and six in one day," Schulte said. "We had a guy in this part of the country working in a hay field and he got mauled." The two schools in the district with wildlife fences are Wapiti and Valley Elementary. Both are in the mountains and pretty isolated, he said. "There are so few people who live up there and it's not practical to bus those kids to Cody so we put a teacher up there," the superintendent said, adding that "grizzly bear ... travel through there." After hearing DeVos mentioned the Wapiti school, the superintendent went on the internet to read about it. To his knowledge, it's the first time his school with 10 kids has been mentioned in a congressional hearing. Grizzlies are currently in hibernation, noted Schulte.

Bob Corker, who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told CNN's Manu Raju Tuesday that he would "absolutely" offer former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson for a floor vote even if he is not given the blessing of his committee, which oversees the nomination. "I plan on moving Tillerson to the floor," Corker said. "Without getting into all the machinations, I would expect there to be a vote of Rex Tillerson on the floor and I expect him to be confirmed." Corker said the committee vote would likely happen Monday. Any single Republican can present an obstacle to his nomination should all Democrats vote against him. Some Republicans on the panel, most prominently Marco Rubio of Florida, have expressed deep concern about Tillerson's ties to Russia and its leader, Vladimir Putin. Corker said he had not spoken to Rubio recently about his thinking, but he predicted some Democrats would also support Tillerson.

"These past two weeks we have seen repeated efforts from the Trump transition, aided and abetted by Senate Republicans, to jam through nominees (in a way) that hides their views from the American people," said Sen. Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, after a meeting with his caucus during which they strategized over a path forward on the nominees. Schumer's escalated rhetoric came as Republicans pressed Democrats to get Trump's nominees confirmed quickly, including as many as seven on Friday, in the hours after Trump is sworn in. The New York Democrat's skeptical comments remarks indicate he may not be willing to confirm that many, a sentiment confirmed to CNN by other Democratic senators and aides. In fact, Schumer said GOP handling of several of the nominations could cause Democrats to slow down confirmations. He warned Democrats may demand "extensive debate" on the floor for some of the nominees. If Democrats decide to put the brakes on floor action -- something they can easily do using procedures of the Senate -- it could cause a backup confirming Trump's Cabinet. The Senate is only in session two days next week as both parties are leaving Washington for their annual legislative retreats. Schumer presented a long list of complaints about how he thinks Republicans have mishandled the confirmation process of some of the more controversial of Trump's picks. For instance, he said the hearing for education secretary nominee Betty DeVos was held at night, making it harder for the American public to focus on it. And he said Democrats were limited in their ability to probe DeVos and Health and Human Services secretary nominee Rep. Tom Price, R-Georgia, because each senator was limited to just one round of questions. Sen. Lamar Alexander, chairman of Senate HELP Committee, on Wednesday night pushed back on Schumer and said that Price's hearing was longer than the last six HHS nominees dating back to 1993, and DeVos' was longer than the last two education secretary nominees. "The Democrats are making up excuses because they can't find better reasons to oppose the nominees," Alexander said. Schumer also complained that there were only seven seats set aside for the public at the hearing for Scott Pruitt, Trump's nominee to head the Environmental Protection Agency, who is under fire from environmentalists and he decried that Democrats were limited in their ability to get outside witnesses to testify about some of the nominees. Most importantly, he said, DeVos testified before she had reached an agreement with the government ethics office to ensure she would not have any financial conflicts of interests if she is confirmed to run the department. "It's an affront to the openness and transparency that the American people are entitled to," Schumer said. "This is a swamp Cabinet full of bankers and billionaires." Fresh allegations that Price may have improperly traded stocks and the Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-South Carolina, who is tapped by Trump to run the Office of Management and Budget, didn't pay taxes for a nanny, are further complicating the situation, Schumer said. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the GOP whip, warned Democrats against overreaching. "I'm sure they'll try to grab for every straw they can to delay the President-elect's Cabinet. Don't get me wrong, I think there should be a thorough vetting, and people should have to answer all the hard questions. But delay for delay's sake should be unacceptable," he said. While Democrats can complain about the process and delay confirmations, they are limited in their ability actually to block nominees. New Senate rules, installed by Democrats last Congress over the objections of Republicans, mean all the nominees can be approved on 51 votes, not the 60 that was the norm for controversial choices. Schumer indicated that three of Trump's national security picks -- Ret. Gen. James Mattis, Trump's nominee to be defense secretary, Ret. Gen. John Kelly, the secretary of homeland security nominee and Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kansas, the CIA director nominee -- may get confirmed on Inauguration Day. But he said negotiations over them and all the other nominees were still underway. Another nominee, Elaine Chao to head the department of transportation, may get confirmed, too. She is the wife of McConnell and a former Cabinet member under George W. Bush. Republicans pushed back on Schumer's complaints and pointed to what they said was their cooperation with President Barack Obama when they helped confirm seven nominees on the day he was sworn in. "When President Obama was elected, Republicans and Democrats worked together and expeditiously to carefully consider his nominees. The Senate held hearings on multiple nominees before he was even sworn in," said McConnell spokesman Don Stewart. "Sen. Schumer and others approved wholeheartedly of this approach at the time, so it's surprising that they'd object to treating the incoming president's nominees with the same courtesy and seriousness with which the Senate acted on President Obama's nominees."

Mick Mulvaney did not pay more than $15,000 in payroll taxes for a household employee was "disqualifying" for him to serve as White House budget director. "When other previous cabinet nominees failed to pay their fair share in taxes, Senate Republicans forced those nominees to withdraw from consideration," the New York Democrat said in a statement. "If failure to pay taxes was disqualifying for Democratic nominees, then the same should be true for Republican nominees." Mulvaney admitted in a questionnaire, a portion of which was provided by a congressional source to CNN Wednesday and sent to the Senate Budget Committee that he failed to pay the taxes in question. In the questionnaire provided to CNN, Mulvaney wrote that, "Upon discovery of that shortfall, I paid the federal taxes," adding that the relevant penalties and interest "are not yet determined." The New York Times first A source from President-elect Donald Trump's transition team told CNN that Mulvaney, who at the time was the father of newborn triplets, hired a "sitter" and didn't realize he needed to pay taxes on her income. The aide declined to say where the employee was from. "He was shown paperwork at the time that indicated she was here in the US legally and could work," the source told CNN, adding, "this mistake was made as he brought home newborn triplets from the NICU and was trying to get some help for his family." Trump's transition team responded by calling attention to comments Schumer made defending Obama's former treasury secretary Timothy Geithner who admitted to paying self-employment taxes from 2001-2004. "The fact of the matter is that nobody is more qualified and more prepared to fight to rein in Washington spending and fight for taxpayers than Mick Mulvaney," transition spokesman John Czwartacki said in a statement. "Congressman Mulvaney raised the issue surrounding the care of his premature triplets immediately upon being tapped for this position, and has taken the appropriate follow-up measures." At a press conference on Wednesday, Schumer invoked the case of former Democratic Senator Tom Daschle, who was forced to withdraw as President Barack Obama's nominee as Health and Human Services secretary in 2009 after it was discovered he failed to pay taxes for a driver and for unreported income. The New York Democrat told reporters on Capitol Hill that like Daschle, because of the unpaid taxes, Mulvaney, a South Carolina congressman, "shouldn't be there." But the source close to Mulvaney pushed back at the comparison to Daschle, saying ""is a stretch to say the least," noting the amount of the unpaid tax by Daschle was significantly higher than the $15,000 Mulvaney paid after he discovered his mistake. Mulvaney is known as an advocate for financial conservatism, and past revelations of failing to pay taxes have kept the Senate from supporting nominees. Speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill, Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn downplayed the report. "I'm sure they'll try to grab for every straw they can to delay the President-elect's Cabinet," he said. "Don't get me wrong, I think there should be a thorough vetting, and people should have to answer all the hard questions. But delay for delay's sake should be unacceptable." ©President-elect Donald Trump's foray into health policy was perhaps best described by a senior Republican congressional aide with a long history of working through the complexities of the issue as "not helpful." Trump's decision to weigh in -- telling In a series of interviews with GOP lawmakers and staff over the course of the first two weeks of the new Congress, it's clear there is a genuine enthusiasm about the possibilities a Trump presidency presents. Years of fighting losing battles with the veto pen awaiting all of their priorities in the White House are now, in a few days, gone. But any excitement is almost immediately hedged with some level of trepidation -- there simply aren't many people, if anyone, in the senior GOP ranks who appear to have much insight into what Trump is actually thinking. Repeatedly in the first few weeks, Republicans have found themselves derailed for a day, if not longer, by a Trump interview or tweet that appears to split with the agreed upon intentions or path of the conference on a given day. Lawmakers are prone to roll their eyes when asked questions about Trump's tweets, pledge not to talk about them at all, as Sen. John McCain has done multiple times, or ignore Trump's latest surprise policy prescription entirely, as Sen. John Barrasso did Tuesday when asked about Trump's latest health care comments. "Oh yeah?" said Barrasso, one of the Senate GOP's leading health care policy minds, when CNN asked his thoughts about Trump's statement. He proceeded to walk into a Senate hearing room and close the door. House Speaker Paul Ryan has a direct line to incoming chief of staff and fellow Wisconsin Republican Reince Priebus, one he uses often, and has said repeatedly that he speaks to Trump by phone a few times per week. Even as Trump has appeared to diverge from Ryan and the House on his proposals, Ryan has steadily maintained there is no major daylight on the big issues. "We are in complete sync," Ryan told reporters after it appeared Trump was asking lawmakers to move on their Affordable Care Act replacement plan at a quicker pace than planned. "And we agree, we want to make sure that we move these things concurrently, at the same time, repeal and replace." But Ryan and House GOP leaders have a road map for their repeal and replace process: they did much of it in 2016. While that effort was rejected, whether it was through reconciliation -- the budget mechanism that will allow Republicans to repeal large swaths of the law -- or through piecemeal bills that address the remaining chunks of the law, there is a step-by-step legislative process on which they've already delivered results. All of which were either vetoed or died in the Senate. The contents of Trump's Affordable Care Act replacement plan were -- and are -- a mystery, according to multiple GOP congressional sources. It's an element, needless to say, that to the extent it exists, wasn't expected to be part of their process, they said. Ditto in the Senate, where senior GOP leaders are urging caution -- and patience. "It's the art of the doable," said Senaet Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch. "These things take time." Sen. Lamar Alexander, the chairman of the Senate Health panel, told CNN he was interested in seeing what Trump and his team put together. When Alexander, who is one of a handful of central players in any replacement effort, was asked if he'd had any conversations with Trump or his team about their plan, he replied simply: "I have not." Even as Trump rattles off his policy goals in media interviews and via Twitter, he's largely left it to his legislative team to craft and execute those priorities on Capitol Hill, according to a transition official. That team consists of Vice President-elect Mike Pence and Priebus -- both of whom spent Tuesday in meetings on Capitol Hill -- as well as the incoming deputy chief of staff for legislative affairs, Rick Dearborn. They've been working alongside Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. A transition official stressed that some of these policies are still in their initial stages and added that when Trump unexpectedly weighs in, he's not necessarily offering up a hard and fast policy proclamation. There's still room for negotiation -- a point made with tax reform in mind specifically. Trump stunned Capitol Hill Republicans when he appeared to reject the idea of a border adjustment tax in an interview with But in an admission that seems to encapsulate the frustration GOP officials will face repeatedly in the months ahead, a person familiar with the Trump team's internal discussions on the border adjustment tax even said that it's not the actual tax Trump objects to. But rather, Trump doesn't like framing his plan as a border adjustment tax. "Some of it's the marketing," this person said. After Trump weighed in on the border adjustment tax his spokesman, Sean Spicer, downplayed the distance between the President-elect's policy visions and the legislation Republicans have been crafting on the hill. "I think we're having some serious -- some discussions back-and-forth with key members of Congress, the House and Senate leadership. When we have something to announce, we will," Spicer said Tuesday. "There's always a back and forth between the executive and Congress as to how to get this right." The question, at least on the congressional side of the relationship, remains whether those back-and-forths will lead to firm agreement -- or just something waiting to be undercut later by Trump himself. Hatch, the Utah Republican who has been in the Senate for more than 40 years, chuckled when he was asked if he thought Trump was starting to understand the complexities of Capitol Hill. "I think he's getting there," he said. "I think he's getting there," he said. ©Former President George H.W. Bush and former first lady Barbara Bush are "both on the upswing," Bush family spokesman Jim McGrath said Thursday, adding, "they may not be out of the woods yet, but we can see the edge of the forest." McGrath said Barbara Bush continues to be treated for her bronchitis with antibiotics, and she said she feels "a thousand percent better today." He said President Bush 41 is also on the upswing. He is alert and remains in stable condition in intensive care, and he said the good news he is being actively evaluated for having his breathing tube removed. "He is doing better -- of course he has a ways to go -- but it's hard not to be encouraged," McGrath said Thursday night. McGrath said both had a great night's sleep. Their son Neil Bush has been over to visit. No other family members are flying in because they feel everything is stable and moving in the right direction. Former President George W. Bush is still going to the inauguration, McGrath said. The 92-year-old former President was admitted to the intensive care unit at Houston Methodist Hospital to address "an acute respiratory problem stemming from pneumonia. Doctors performed a procedure to protect and clear his airway that required sedation," McGrath said in an earlier statement. By Wednesday evening, the former President was no longer sedated. McGrath told CNN doctors wanted to keep George H.W. Bush in ICU for observation, because he's still intubated and their intention is to keep his airway open. At first, McGrath reported that he was responding well to the drugs. But Wednesday, the 41st President's condition changed and he was admitted to the intensive care unit, sedated and intubated. "It's definitely very concerning," said Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, who noted that it is the first time President Bush has been intubated to protect his airway. "Certainly when someone is sedated, they're having trouble breathing on their own." Barbara Bush also was admitted to the hospital Wednesday morning as a precaution after "experiencing fatigue and coughing," McGrath said in the same initial statement. McGrath said Wednesday evening the first lady has bronchitis, not pneumonia like her husband. Bush, who served a single term as President from 1989 to 1993, was already not expected to attend the inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump in Washington on Friday due to health concerns. Bush sent a letter to the President-elect on January 10, apologizing for missing the ceremony and saying that he and Barbara "wish you the very best as you begin this incredible journey of leading our great country." "My doctor says if I sit outside in January, it likely will put me six feet under. Same for Barbara," Bush wrote, in a letter first reported by ABC News. "So I guess we're stuck in Texas." Trump responded on Twitter Wednesday, wishing the Bushes a speedy recovery and thanking them for their note. "Looking forward to a speedy recovery for George and Barbara Bush, both hospitalized. Thank you for your wonderful letter!" he tweeted. President Barack Obama said at a White House news conference Wednesday his White House has been in touch with the Bush family. "They have not only dedicated their lives to this country, they have been a constant source of friendship and support and good counsel" over the years, Obama said. "They are as fine a couple as we know," he added, calling the Bushes "really good people." Former President Bill Clinton, also offered his best wishes to his predecessor on Twitter. "41 and Barbara-thinking about you both and sending wishes for a speedy recovery. Love, 42," he wrote. The 41st president has, in fact, heard from all of the former presidents, along with Obama and Trump's teams. President Bush also received a "get well" video from actress Suzanne Somers and his face lit up, McGrath said. Bush revealed several years ago that he suffered from a form of Parkinson's disease that left him unable to walk. He uses a wheelchair or a scooter to get around and had two other health scares in 2014 and 2015. In December 2014, he was hospitalized after experiencing shortness of breath, and the following July fell at his home in Kennebunkport, Maine, breaking the C2 vertebrae in his neck. The injury did not result in any neurological problems, his spokesman said at the time. ©A veteran of the Bush-Cheney White House, Neil Patel, is in talks with President-elect Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to work with him in the White House, according to sources with knowledge of the transition.

Up for reelection in 2018 in West Virginia, which overwhelmingly supported Trump, Manchin has pledged to work closely with the Republican administration. But his declaration suggests that the Republicans have little margin for error on two controversial nominees within their own caucus. "Public education is everything we have," Manchin told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on "The Situation Room," adding that school-choice programs like those backed by DeVos would not work in a rural state like his. "I'm very troubled by that." "I'm concerned about Congressman Price," he added, pointing to Price's proposals to curb Medicare services and his position on funding the battle against the opiate epidemic. Manchin said he was comfortable with Trump's stances on those two issues and hopes Price adopts those, rather than his own, as department head.

Pence said he has looked to Bush's tenure as vice president, in which he "came alongside and supported a strong, visionary leader" as a "great source of inspiration." Bush, of course, followed Reagan into the White House. That, too, may serve as inspiration for Pence, the former Indiana governor who was floated as a potential presidential candidate in 2016 and is now considered a top contender to become the Republican Party's presidential nominee after President-elect Donald Trump's time in office comes to a close. The former congressman is also expected to be a particularly powerful vice president to Trump, who has never served in government. Pence will spend much of his time spearheading the Trump administration's legislative in Congress, where he has been given an office on the House side in addition to the vice presidential office in the Senate side of Capitol Hill. Pence is expected to be a key bridge between GOP leaders and Trump. His selection as Trump's running mate last year was in large part aimed at reassuring conservatives in the party and rallying them around Trump's unconventional candidacy.

"It's being crafted right now," Pence said Wednesday in an interview with CNN's Dana Bash, when asked about a replacement to the President's signature health care law. "We're getting very close. We expect to have that plan come forward in the early days of the administration." Pence's comments came after Trump said in an interview Saturday with The Washington Post that his health care replacement plan "is very much formulated down to the final strokes" -- comments that have worried Republicans on Capitol Hill who believe it will take Congress weeks at least to replace the law, also known as the Affordable Care Act. The incoming vice president also sought to clarify Trump's promise of "insurance for everybody," which also has worried Republicans on Capitol Hill who fear that Trump is overpromising on health care. Pence said he believed Trump's promise of "insurance for everybody" is really about "making insurance affordable for everyone." Pence's comments came in an interview Wednesday in which he reiterated Trump's pledge to repeal and replace Obamacare simultaneously and made clear that Trump transition officials are still working with Republican leaders to cobble together a replacement bill that will ensure Americans don't see a lapse in health care coverage. "What the President-elect has made clear is that he also wants Congress at the same time to pass a replacement bill that will lower the cost of health insurance and literally make health insurance affordable for every American," Pence said. The incoming vice president shook his head when asked if that meant mandating every American have health insurance coverage, as is the case under the Obama's Affordable Care Act, but promised "an orderly transition out of Obamacare." "We don't want anybody to be anxious who has an insurance through an exchange or through the process of Obamacare. We don't want people to be concerned that they're going to lose that coverage and face hardship for their families," Pence said. Pence said he interpreted Trump's comments about a health care replacement law that provides for "insurance for everybody" to mean "making insurance affordable for everyone." "I think it means making insurance affordable for everyone, but also allowing for the kinds of reforms in Medicaid on a state by state basis that will ensure -- that will make sure that we have healthcare coverage for the most vulnerable in our society," Pence said. Republicans on Capitol Hill, including Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orin Hatch, have expressed concerns that Trump is setting expectations too high by promising health insurance coverage to all Americans. They have talked instead about "universal access" to health care coverage. Pence also spoke in his interview with CNN about the first days of the administration, promising that Trump "is going to hit the ground running," including by issuing a series of executive orders to create new policies but also repeal Obama administration policies over the course of the "first several weeks" of Trump's term. Incoming White House Pres Secretary Sean Spicer said Wednesday during a briefing with reporters that Trump will issue several organizational executive orders on Friday after he is inaugurated, but that the first policy-related executive orders are expected to come Monday.

In an interview with CNN's Dana Bash, Pence said simply that he was "aware" of a bipartisan bill moving through Congress designed to impose additional sanctions against Russia. He also refused to answer whether the country's influence campaign in 2016 should be met with "American strength," as he suggested Russian provocations should be met during the vice presidential debate last year. Instead, Pence stressed that President-elect Donald Trump has "made it very clear that he is determined to try and improve" US-Russian relations, and that Trump plans to "reach out with a hand of friendship to all nations of the world." "That's not to ignore the information and evidence ... that we have. That's not to ignore the evidence that we have of Russian involvement in hacking last fall. But it's just his determination to come in, recognizing that we have a terrible relationship with Russia right now and to explore the possibility of improving that relationship," Pence said. Asked whether the incoming administration needed to punish Russia's hacking to ward off similar moves from other countries, Pence demurred. Instead he knocked President Barack Obama's administration for its failed reset with Russia and for not abiding by the red line Obama set with regards to the Syrian conflict. Pence said those moves "eroded the respect for our country" and stressed that other countries will "see America's strength in the Oval Office" with Trump in office. Trump will make clear that "America's interests come first," Pence said. Trump has yet to say whether he plans to keep in place the sanctions the Obama administration imposed to punish Russia over its hacking of Democratic groups to influence the presidential election. For weeks, Trump cast doubt on the intelligence community's conclusions that Russia orchestrated the hacking effort and a broader influence campaign aimed at hurting his rival Hillary Clinton and bolstering his own chances in the election. He finally acknowledged Russia's responsibility in the matter at a news conference last week. Pence for his part said in the 2016 vice presidential debate that "provocations by Russia need to be met with American strength" in relation to the Syrian conflict. Trump subsequently said at the next presidential debate that he disagreed with that view.

Amid those glowing reviews, one-quarter of Americans (25%) say Obama is one of the nation's greatest presidents, far outpacing the share who felt that way about other recent presidents as their terms ended (11% described Reagan that way, 10% Clinton, and 5% or fewer said so about either President Bush). Still, nearly as many (23%) call Obama a poor president, more than said so about Reagan, Clinton or the first president Bush, but well below the 46% who said George W. Bush was a poor president as he prepared to leave the White House. That assessment of Obama's presidency, as well as his approval ratings, are marked by sharp partisan divides. While 54% of Democrats consider Obama one of the greatest presidents, 54% of Republicans call him a poor president. Though he has earned near universal approval among Democrats (95% approve), just 18% of Republicans say they approve of how he handled the presidency. That gap explains the difference between Obama's approval rating and those of the two former presidents who left office with higher marks. Both Reagan and Clinton held approval ratings above 9-in-10 among their own partisans, yet their approval ratings among those in the opposing party outpaced Obama's, with 39% of Republicans saying they approved of Clinton at the end of his term and 38% of Democrats approving of Reagan as he prepared to leave office. Looking back at the critical issues of the Obama years, Americans give the President positive ratings for handling several issues that were central to his first run for office: the economy, foreign affairs and race relations among them. Obama took office several months after a massive stock market crash and amid a crisis in the nation's housing market, and at a time when international impressions of the United States were at a low point, according to polls. At the time of his inauguration, 72% expected there to be at least some improvement in race relations following his election as the first black president. In the new poll, Obama also scores net-positive approval ratings for his work on education, policies toward gays and lesbians, environmental policy and climate change, all areas where policies shifted sharply during Obama's tenure. Majorities disapprove, however, of Obama's work on gun policy, an issue he embraced following the death of 20 children and six adults in a shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, and his handling of ISIS, which rose to prominence during his time in office. And the public is mixed on his handling of two top domestic issues -- illegal immigration and health care policy -- and two national security concerns -- terrorism and cybersecurity. All told, Obama's time comes to an end with 50% saying things in the country are generally going well, 50% that they're going poorly. That's a sharp increase compared with the start of Obama's time in office. In early 2009, in the midst of an economic crisis, just 21% said things in the country were heading the right way, that rose to 49% by the time of Obama's second inauguration, and peaked at 54% just before last year's election. Similarly, there's been a sharp turnaround in impressions of the economy under Obama. Now, 57% say economic conditions are good, compared with 13% in January 2009. Much of that improvement in opinions on the economy came during Obama's second term. In December, 2012, just after his re-election, that figure had risen to just 26%. Looking ahead, the public is split on whether the country will be better (47%) or worse off (48%) four years from now, but they are more apt to see improvement on the horizon for the economy, 62% say that will be better a year from today. Asked about their own financial situation, 40% expect it to improve in the next year, 48% say it'll be the same and 11% that it'll get worse in the first year of Trump's presidency. Obama's favorability rating stands at 63%, among the best for recent presidents and his highest since summer 2009. First lady Michelle Obama scores a 69% favorability rating, her highest mark since 2012, matching her favorability rating in January 2009 just ahead of Obama's first inauguration.

"They were disappointed," Obama said on Wednesday at his final White House news conference. "They paid attention to what their mom said during the campaign and believed it because it's consistent with what we tried to teach them in our household, and what I've tried to model as a father with their mom and what we've asked them to expect from future boyfriends or spouses." Obama, and especially First Lady Michelle Obama, had prosecuted a fairly personal case against President-elect Donald Trump on the campaign trail, including an indictment of his treatment toward women. Obama said Malia and Sasha Obama, however, knew not to "mope" and that the country had not rejected the values that they believed in. He recalled dinner conversations with them about the country's "core decency" and said their attitude had not turned dour. "What we've also tried to teach them is resilience and we've tried to give them hope," Obama said, "and that the only thing that is the end of the world is the end of the world." "What we've also tried to teach them is resilience and we've tried to give them hope," Obama said, "and that the only thing that is the end of the world is the end of the world." ©Barack Obama used his departing words as President Wednesday to offer an assured -- if not entirely optimistic -- outlook for a country governed by Donald Trump. "At my core I think we're going to be OK," Obama said as he concluded his final news conference at the White House. "We just have to fight for it, work for it, and not take it for granted." "I know that you will help us do that," he told reporters assembled in the White House briefing room. If the message was still hopeful, it was a sharp downgrade from the grand visions of progressive change that propelled Obama to the presidency eight years ago. In his question-and-answer session with reporters, Obama said that after two terms of political warfare with Republicans, he was emerging unbowed in his faith in the US and its citizens. But he continued to express concerns about his successor's stance on Russia and his readiness for office. "I believe in this country. I believe in the American people. I believe that people are more good than bad," Obama said. "I believe tragic things happen. I think there's evil in the world, but I think at the end of the day, if we work hard and if we're true to those things in us that feel true and feel right, that the world gets a little better each time." "That's what this presidency has tried to be about," he continued. Conceding that Trump may not take his advice on issues, Obama said he would avoid weighing in on specific policy matters during his post-presidency, using his time instead to write and "not hear myself talk so darn much." But he predicted he would voice concern if "core values" are being threatened. "I put in that category if I saw systematic discrimination being ratified in some fashion. I put in that category explicit or functional obstacles to people being able to vote, to exercise their franchise," Obama said. Obama said he was calmed by the notion of the Oval Office as a moderating factor on Trump's bombastic tendencies. He said once Trump gets into office and is hit with the intricate details of governing, his thinking might shift on issues such as Obamacare and jobs. "Once he comes into office and he looks at the complexities of how to in fact provide healthcare for everybody, something he says he wants to do, or wants to make sure that he is encouraging job creation and wage growth in this country, that may lead him to some of the same conclusions that I arrived at once I got here," Obama said. "But I don't think we'll know until he has an actual chance to get sworn in and sit behind that desk." In a news conference that will likely mark the final time Obama speaks in public before he departs the US Capitol on Friday as an ex-president, Obama described the phone calls between him and Trump as "constructive" and at times "lengthy." He said the greatest advice he could give -- and has given -- to Trump, is to rely on others around him. "This is a job of such magnitude that you can't do it by yourself," Obama said. Obama opened the news conference rebuffing Trump, issuing a vocal defense of the White House press corps, insisting the reporters who covered his administration were an essential facet of a functioning democracy. "We are accountable to the people who send us here. And you have done it," Obama said. "You're not supposed to be sycophants. You're supposed to be skeptics." His remarks stood in direct contrast to the incoming president, who has lambasted news organizations reporting on his transition as reporting " Obama was continuing a tradition of taking reporters' questions for a final time before departing office. George W. Bush held his final news conference a week before leaving office, reflecting on some of the disappointments of his administration but also defending the controversial decisions he made over two terms in the White House. Unlike Bush, Obama is leaving office with near-record approval ratings. Obama's concluding news conference comes amid a flurry of last-minute activity, including handing down a commutation for national security leaker Chelsea Manning and a pardon for Gen. James Cartwright, convicted of lying to investigators in a leak probe. Obama defended the decision to commute Manning's sentence, saying that she served a "tough prison sentence." He said he looked at the particulars of the case the same way he had any other person whose sentence he had commuted. "I felt that in light of all the circumstances, that commuting her sentence was entirely appropriate," Obama said from the briefing room. He said the time she's already spent in jail would function as a deterrent for any future leakers while warning other potential whistleblowers to use established government channels to air grievances about the actions of the US government. But he said that "justice has been served" for Manning, a transgender woman who has been serving time at an all-male military prison in Kansas. "The sentence that she received was very disproportionate relative to what other leakers had received," Obama said. "It made sense to commute and not pardon her sentence." The decision has been lambasted by Republicans, who have accused Manning of being a traitor for disclosing hundreds of thousands of pages related to classified US programs. Ties between the incoming and outgoing administrations have strained over Trump's relationship with Russia, which the US accuses of meddling in November's election. Trump has proposed friendlier ties to Moscow, which he said would lead to greater partnership on a series of sticky global issues from Syria to Ukraine. Obama offered a cautious note on developing friendlier ties to Moscow, saying a constructive US-Russia relationship is "in America's interest and the world's interest." But he said fostering warmer ties during his presidency was stymied by Russian President Vladimir Putin's combative stance when he returned to power in 2012. Putin's "adversarial spirit" had "made the relationship more difficult," Obama said. Putin's "adversarial spirit" had "made the relationship more difficult," Obama said. ©"The only thing that is the end of the world is the end of the world." With that parting message to the nation, a sanguine Barack Obama sought to reassure the millions of Democrats disorientated and fearful about Donald Trump's pending inauguration that presidents may change but the nation always endures. Still, in his Obama drew a figurative line between his about-to-expire administration and the incoming Republican one that aims to destroy much of his legacy. His comments established an implicit scorecard for voters to use when judging which vision of government they prefer in the years ahead. Obama also struck a striking stylistic contrast with the President-elect, hinting at the change that will come to White House optics in two days. But mostly he offered a message of reassurance at a time of national uncertainty after the most tumultuous presidential transition in modern history. "This is not just a matter of no drama Obama, this is what I really believe," Obama told reporters in the White House press briefing room. "It is true that behind closed doors, I curse more than I do publicly ... and sometimes I get mad and frustrated like everybody else does. But at my core, I think we're going to be OK." "We just have to fight for it," he added. "We have to work for it and not take it for granted." Obama's characteristic sangfroid was a notable contrast to the political division and anxiety that emerged from last year's bitter campaign season. But Obama, citing the resilience of his daughters Malia and Sasha after the shock of the election, told his supporters: "We've tried to teach them hope and that the only thing that is the end of the world is the end of the world." Obama's final news conference was also a chance for Obama, as aides packed up their belongings in the maze of West Wing offices behind the briefing room, to display the courtly manner that has rarely slipped in eight White House years. He was constrained and cool, chose vocabulary that tiptoed around controversy, and called on journalists from a list prepared by his staff. His interactions with reporters was respectful but mostly distant. It was one last chance to witness the professorial demeanor that comes across to many Republicans as patronizing. Things will change from Friday at noon. Just a week ago, in his own news conference, the President-elect oozed passion and a relentless relish for confrontation. He called on reporters not off a pre-planned rotation but with a swing of his arm. With a 60% approval rating on his way out the door, Still, Trump won the only contest that matters in November and will now have the chance to wipe out much of Obama's legacy. That successive elections could have produced such different presidents in temperament and political background perhaps shows the elasticity of the American political system and the uncertainty of the times. Obama, conscious that his successor was probably watching on television, sought to avoid open conflicts with Trump even as the contrasts were clear. He mounted a ringing defense of a free media and the need for the White House press corps to hold a president to account from within the West Wing itself -- a status Trump aides have already suggested may be at risk. In a clear nod to the push for the diversity that has been an undercurrent of his administration, Obama's questioners included a Latina woman, a journalist for an Arab television channel, an African American woman and a man who works for an LGBT publication. After an hour-and-a-quarter, Obama simply said "Thank you very much, press corps -- good luck" as a presidency that opened in a euphoric blast of hope and change slipped quietly into its final hours. ©While evaluations of President Barack Obama vary widely in various subsets of black America, hundreds of Obama mentions in hip-hop over the last nine years show that the immediate legacy of the first black president will not only be shaped by his accomplishments, but by the challenges he faced and by the policies of presidents yet to come, who could either advance his work, or dismantle it. A CNN analysis of Obama mentions in song lyrics reveals a divide in hip-hop over whether Obama did enough to uplift black America. A particular artist's opinion of the first black President is tempered by the their mistrust or acceptance of establishment politics. Lyrics that came out between 2007-2016 chronicle the idealism of 2008, the disappointment that followed, the pride that transcends politics and how the nation's first black president and the rise of his successor, Donald Trump, forced America to confront its ongoing struggle for racial justice. Evaluations of Obama are often shaped by whether the artist is part of mainstream hip-hop or the counterculture, and whether the artist is assessing Obama "as a leader of the free world" or as a revolutionary leader who was expected to "bring about radical change," Bakari Kitwana, the Executive Director of The video features exuberant crowds with Obama posters, surrounded by names of iconic African American leaders, black children holding up newspapers announcing Obama's win and a jubilant Rep.

"I think Obama provides hope and challenges minds of all races and colors to erase the hate and try to love one another," Nas raps in the 2008 track, Chicago rapper Common, who was invited to the White House and has remained one of Obama's most loyal supporters, paid tribute to the incoming President in his 2007 song, And once Obama took office, Brooklyn rapper Maino released "You've been seeing me lately, I'm a miracle baby/ I refuse to lose, this what the ghetto done made me/ I put that on my father, trying to hope for tomorrow/ When I think that I can't, I envision Obama." As Obama's first term in office came to an end and partisan politics kept Congress deadlocked, poverty and hardships endured in the inner cities and the prospects of change seemed dim. "Button on his lapel, picture of Obama/ Four years later we stuck in the same drama," Brooklyn rapper GZA raps in Wu Block's 2012 song, And in October 2015, Jeezy strikes a darker tone in "Seen a black president, I ain't see no change tho/ They say street life numb ya, all I feel is pain tho," Jeezy raps. "... All the good jobs firin, ups ain't hiring/ Man this stress getting tiring in these streets." The video takes place in a cemetery, as names of those killed by street violence flash across the screen. "When we talk about Obama not being able to do enough for black people, a part of the problem is that the needs are so great," Kitwana said. "... These issues are so huge that it would be impossible for him to solely focus on those things without getting push back from the right." Obama, who has commuted the sentences of 1,000 inmates to date -- more than the past 11 presidents combined, made criminal justice reform more of a focus during his second term in office, promoting new initiatives to rehabilitate former prison inmates, commuting sentences of non-violent drug offenders and becoming the first sitting president to visit a federal prison. Jeezy told CNN in November 2015 that while he would have "gone much further" on issues like criminal justice reform, Obama's efforts are "better late than never." "I think that's a great gesture by Obama ... and that's the beginning of some type of slight change," he added. Chicago rapper Vic Mensa told CNN that while representing black people "was not necessarily his job," Obama "could have been a lot more vocally sympathetic" to issues that impact black America. Lyrics show that Obama was criticized for not speaking out on race and racism, particularly on the issue of police brutality, which gained mainstream media attention following the 2014 "People saw Obama go and speak about Sandy Hook when young people were killed and then they saw Mike Brown get shot in broad daylight and the president didn't say anything," Kitwana said. "That hurt a lot of people." Over the last two years, the Justice Department, headed by Obama-appointed Attorney General Loretta Lynch, launched several investigations into police departments around the nation, "We haven't been convicting police officers for their murders," Mensa said. "If Obama was to address it he would give you 45 seconds of why we need to respect our officers and give you 15 seconds about how they might be going wrong, and that's not an honest assessment of the situation," he added. In The Game's 2016 song, Long Beach rapper Crooked I told CNN that while he was heart broken by the President's silence on the 2014 This was demonstrated by the intense backlash leveled against him following his response to the 2012 shooting death of Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old unarmed teenager from Sanford, Florida. Obama was accused by Republicans, from Rush Limbaugh to Newt Gingrich, of inciting racial divisions following his heartfelt message to Martin's parents, where he said, "If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon." "When Obama said Trayvon resembled 'em/ Nobody hurried to arrest George Zimmerman," Brooklyn rapper Papoose raps in the 2012 song, While Obama rose to become the leader of the free world, lyrics show that he was simultaneously viewed as a victim of the American establishment and as a mouthpiece for a capitalistic, imperialist superpower that has kept people of color down. "The Republicans said on day-one ... they're going to make him a one-term president, and that they're going to give him hell," Crooked I said. "I've never seen a person of power get treated like that ... that would have never happened to a white president." New York rapper stic.man of the hip-hop duo Dead Prez warns in the 2008 song Atlanta rapper Killer Mike, an establishment critic who backed Bernie Sanders in 2016, echoes a similar sentiment in his "Ronald Reagan was an actor, not at all a factor/ Just an employee of the country's real masters," Killer Mike raps, criticizing American militarism and the war on drugs. "Just like the Bushes, Clinton and Obama/ Just another talking head telling lies on teleprompters." In his 2013 song "The black and brown been going through a holocaust/ You see Obama just a house n**** to me," Staples raps. "They locked the children up in prison and they ditching the key." And in The Game's 2014 song But as "(Trump) can't make decisions for this country, he gon' crash us/ No, we can't be a slave for him/ He got me appreciatin' Obama way more," Compton rapper YG raps in the 2016 anti-Trump anthem "FDT," which stands for "F*** Donald Trump."

I also knew that the man who could not countenance such a thing in his America had been responsible for the only time in my life when I felt, as the first lady had once said, proud of my country," he writes. And Jeezy, whose lyrics are both reminiscent of the idealism of 2008 and the disappointment that followed, still maintains that Obama "gave us hope."

The country's response to that crisis helped reshape the economy and the makeup of the political system a few times over. And for every day of those eight years, the nation was at war -- on multiple fronts, against multiple groups for multiple purposes.

By the ©President Barack Obama broke out the term "fake news" in reference to concerns about voter fraud on Wednesday, making the case that voting should be easier, not more difficult. Obama was asked in his final news conference as President about race relations in the US, saying that "inequality" was what concerns him most. "I worry about inequality because I think if we are not investing in making sure everybody plays a role in this economy, the economy will not grow as fast, and I think it will also lead to further and further separation between us as Americans," Obama said. "Not just along racial lines -- here are a whole lot of folks who voted for (President-elect Donald) Trump because they feel left behind. ... You don't want to have an America in which a very small sliver of people is doing very well and everybody else is fighting for scraps, because that's oftentimes when racial divisions get magnified." He mentioned in particular access to voting as a key concern of his -- nothing that the oft-cited explanation for restrictive voting laws of widespread fraud is inaccurate. "This is something that has constantly been disproved," Obama said. "This is fake news." Obama also said the premise that millions of Americans were trying to vote but ineligible was the opposite of reality. "We have a whole country of people who are eligible to vote who don't vote," Obama said. "And so the whole idea that we put in place a bunch of barriers to people voting doesn't make sense." He added that limits to voting rights "traces directly back to Jim Crow and the legacy of slavery." The outgoing President is expected to take an active interest in issues of voting as he leaves office. His former attorney general, Eric Holder, is chairing a new Democratic organization aimed to engage in the next redistricting cycle to combat another issue Obama mentioned Wednesday -- gerrymandering. Obama said earlier in the news conference that he views a difference between normal political back-and-forth and issues where "our core values may be at stake," saying the latter may prompt him to speak out. "I'd put in that category: if I saw systematic discrimination being ratified in some fashion," Obama said. "I'd put in that category explicit or functional obstacles to people being able to vote, to exercise their franchise. I'd put in that category institutional efforts to silence dissent or the press. And for me, at least, I would put in that category efforts to round up kids who have grown up here and for all practical purposes are American kids and send them someplace else." The term "fake news" began as a way to identify inaccurate propaganda that rose during the election that purported to be legitimate media. It has also since been used by both sides of the political spectrum to malign the other or to express disagreement. The expert analysis on voting has found that actual instances of voter fraud are extremely low, a small handful among millions of votes cast in an election. Supporters of measures designed to combat voting fraud have cited studies that found the potential for fraud is much greater.

The Education Department said Wednesday it is withdrawing a proposed policy that would have dramatically increased federal control over school-district budgets, because it "did not have time to publish a strong final regulation." Even if the department had adopted the regulation by Friday, it would have faced strong opposition from Republicans in Congress, who could have overturned it with a majority vote and a presidential signature. Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tennessee, welcomed the department's move today and said the regulation would have violated a federal law enacted in 2015 that aims to give states and school districts more control over education. "This proposal would have dictated from Washington how states and school districts should spend nearly all state and local tax dollars on schools in order to receive federal Title I dollars," Alexander said a statement. Title I is a federal program that provides roughly $15 billion a year to schools and districts with large numbers of low-income students. Alexander, chairman of the Senate education committee, was the main congressional sponsor of the 2015 law. The Education Department had worked on the regulation for a year and envisioned it as a way to ensure that the nation's 14,000 school districts spent the same amount of state and local money per pupil in their various schools. The department had found that many school districts spend less per pupil in schools eligible for Title I funds than they spend in schools that are not eligible. The just-withdrawn regulation would have required districts nationwide to shift a total of $800 million to Title I schools from non-Title I schools, or to spend an additional $2.2 billion in state and local funds on Title I schools. "There are still far too many places in this country where the students getting the most support end up getting the least," said Education Department press secretary Dorie Nolt in a statement.

Sometimes they end with the newly sworn-in president jumping out of a White House window. Intrigued yet? Whether you're stoked or bummed about the way the election turned out, here are some fun facts to make you look like a history buff to your friends as the Yes, this stuff really happened. What, you don't remember who William Henry Harrison is? Probably because while he That's what his official cause of death was, but that's been Harrison became the first president to die in office and served the shortest tenure in US history. It was Lincoln's second inauguration in 1865, the first time African-Americans participated in the inaugural parade. Concerns about Lincoln's safety lingered. His inauguration four years earlier was the first to incorporate major security measures. There was a guest in the crowd that day in 1865 who would become Lincoln's biggest threat.

Some say it was a wild party where furniture was destroyed and the mob of people had to be lured outside with punch. Others say the riotous atmosphere was fabricated into lore by Jackson's enemies. No one disputes that the number of people at the party was insane. Jackson had to get out. So did he really escape through a White House window or did his staff quietly escort him from the property? Depends on which account you believe. The actual oath, During his first inauguration in 1789 in New York, it is said that George Washington Why did Washington take the oath in New York? That was the seat of the government at the time. Thomas Jefferson was the first president to be inaugurated in Washington, in 1801 after it became the capital city.

Ford, 1974 inauguration, referring to Watergate ~ "Government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem." -- Ronald Reagan, 1981 inauguration ©Scott Pruitt, Donald Trump's pick to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, broke with the President-elect Wednesday and said he doesn't believe climate change is a "hoax." But in testimony before the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, Pruitt didn't indicate he would take swift action to address environmental issues that may contribute to climate change. Instead, the Oklahoma attorney general said there is still debate over how to respond. "Science tells us the climate is changing and human activity in some matter impacts that change," Pruitt said. "The ability to measure and pursue the degree and the extent of that impact and what to do about it are subject to continuing debate and dialogue." That stance puts Pruitt in line with the climate change views of several other Trump Cabinet picks, including Rex Tillerson and Ryan Zinke, who have acknowledged the issue but haven't committed to an aggressive response. Trump once called climate change a "hoax" invented by the Chinese and, during his campaign for president, repeatedly questioned scientific conclusions that human activity has caused global warming. More recently, he has acknowledged "some connectivity" between human activity and climate change. Pruitt, who has long viewed the EPA skeptically and has sued the agency repeatedly as Oklahoma attorney general, is a lightning rod of a pick. As the hearing got underway, protesters criticizing Pruitt for his ties to the oil industry outside the room were clearly audible. A handful of protesters were escorted out of the hearing. Pruitt said the EPA serves a critical mission and detailed how the agency under his leadership would take a dramatically different approach than under President Barack Obama. He accused the agency under Obama of flouting congressional rules and ignoring the desires of states. Pruitt said "rule of law matters" and that as EPA director he would "follow the law" and regulations set out by Congress, a suggestion that the current leadership has not done that. It is likely that Pruitt, despite views that are abhorrent to many Democrats, will be confirmed as the next head of the EPA. But Democrats want to make him pay for it and plan to push the Republican on some of his past comments about climate and his ties to energy companies. Pruitt And lawyers with the Environmental Defense Fund tell CNN that Pruitt filed at least 12 lawsuits challenging environmental protections as attorney general. Pruitt, in particular, sued over the EPA's clean power plan, which seeks to curb carbon emissions from power plants and attempts to curb methane emissions from the oil and gas industry. Bernie Sanders, the liberal Vermont senator who railed against the fossil fuel industry during his 2016 presidential campaign, hammered Pruitt for questioning the impact humans have on climate change. Pruitt said his personal views on climate change are "immaterial" to whether he should lead the EPA, arguing that his prospective job is about following Congress' guidance, not his own personal beliefs. "Really?" Sanders asked incredulously. "You are going to be the head of the agency to protect the environment and your personal feelings about whether climate change is caused by human activity and carbon emission is immaterial?" Pruitt stood by the statement, telling Sanders that his job as administrator would be to "carry out statutes passed by this body." He sought to beat back concerns about his ties to the energy industry by arguing it is wrong to say someone who is pro-energy is inherently anti-environment. "First, we must reject the false paradigm that if you are pro-energy, you are anti-environment and if you are pro-environment, you are anti-energy," he said. "I utterly reject the narrative." But environmental activists call Pruitt dangerous and Democrats on the committee will look to put his views of science and climate change on trial. Sen. Tom Carper of Delaware, the top Democrat on the committee, has labeled the Oklahoma Republican "Polluting Pruitt" since his nomination was announced and argued that an EPA head that does not "recognize the damaging effects of climate change on our environment and economy" is not qualified for the job. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat, hammered Pruitt for his ties to a number of oil companies through his campaigns for attorney general, his super PACs and the Republican Attorneys General Association. Whitehouse called some of his ties "a complete black hole" of money, alleging that Pruitt could be conflicted when dealing with some energy companies due to his fundraising. Pruitt denied soliciting money from Koch Industries and others for the Rule of Law Defense Fund and noted that, as attorney general, he also sued energy companies. According to the National Institute on Money in State Politics, Pruitt has received more than $300,000 from interests close to the fossil fuel industry since 2002. Many Senate Republicans, however, see Pruitt as the right person to lead what they view as a wasteful agency that over-regulates, especially because Oklahoma is the biggest oil and natural gas-producing state in the nation. Pruitt said he believes mistakes were made in the handling of lead poisoning in Flint, Michigan, blaming the Obama administration's EPA for not moving faster. "As you know, the Clean Water Act and The Safe Drinking Water Act, if there is an emergency situation, the EPA can enter an emergency order to address those kind of concerns," Pruitt said. "I think there should have been a more fast response, a more rapid response to Flint, Michigan." Pruitt's main argument during the start of his hearing has been that the states should have more power within the EPA, but on this issue, he argued that the federal government agency should have had more power to respond. Sen. Ben Cardin, a Maryland Democrat, pressed Pruitt on his lawsuits against the EPA, charging the body with overreach in state matters. Pruitt said on issues of air quality and water quality and inter-state issues, the EPA is particularly necessary.

The decade-long case highlighted specific instances dating back to 1995 claiming that each of the African-American agents were not selected for specific promotions, assignments, positions and career enhancing opportunities they were qualified for but were given to white agents. Testimonies reveal that the agents each bid for up to 230 positions within the agency before being promoted. One of the agents explained that she was "passed over for promotion in favor or a white (male) agent who had previously been transferred, as a result of sexually harassing her." Desmond Hogan, co-lead lawyer representing the agents said that the settlement "means that black Secret Service Agents will not be constrained by the glass ceiling that held back so many so many for so long when it came time to fill the leadership positions at the Secret Service." The initial lawsuit was filed in 2000 under the administration of former president Bill Clinton. Jeh Johnson, Secretary of Homeland Security which presides over the Secret Service, said in a statement that he is "pleased that we are able to finally put this chapter of Secret Service history behind us. ... This settlement is also, simply, the right thing to do." "Had the matter gone to trial, it would have required that we re-live things long past, just at a time when the Secret Service is on the mend. Under Joe Clancy's leadership, the Secret Service has turned the corner, and today's settlement is part of that," Johnson said in the statement. Cathy Milhoan, Communications Director for the Secret Service, explained that "the agreement explicitly states that the U.S. Secret Service denies any and all liability or damages to anyone with respect to the alleged facts or causes of action asserted in the litigation." "The Secret Service recognizes that having a diverse cohort of supervisors makes the agency stronger and better equipped to successfully accomplish our mission. This settlement demonstrates and reaffirms our commitment to continually enhance our promotion system," Milhoan said in a statement. The Secret Service admits to "no wrongdoings or institutional bias," according to an email sent to agency employees.

Not really the words themselves, but how they were delivered. As Barack Obama wraps up eight years of presidential speeches, where every word can move markets and change lives, Trump has been rewriting the rule book. "The Trump election has made the case that presidential rhetoric needs to respond to Americans who are looking for a different way to communicate - how you can connect with them on their turf," said In other words, experts say, we've entered a new phase in the way presidents talk to the people. The days of ornately written speeches, like the ones history recorded from Lincoln, Jefferson, Roosevelt and Kennedy, are rapidly dwindling in a world where everyone has the attention of a flea and anyone can command their own virtual megaphone online. But despite the growing noise, Obama has left a pretty clear legacy of presidential rhetoric. These are the speeches experts rank as the best of his two terms, with an insider's view on how they were crafted. Obama first established his reputation as a powerful, influential speaker in 2008, when he broadened his "Yes we can" campaign slogan beyond supporters and invited all Americans to share his commitment to change. He did the same in 2012, this time showing his ability to connect emotionally with the public after the school massacre in Newtown, Connecticut: Several "great speeches of Obama's presidency were after national tragedies, which struck the right note," said But Jamieson feels like Obama didn't always hit the mark. During his first inaugural address, he failed to digest a core idea into a single memorable phrase - like Franklin Roosevelt did in 1933 with, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself." On the other hand, Obama did create a history-making moment in 2015 on the 50th anniversary of the civil rights marches from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, when he delivered an address that many experts said rates among his best. "That is a powerful ... beautifully constructed speech," Jamieson said. When it comes to putting pen to paper, those who worked with Obama say each speech largely was crafted by the President himself -- especially the important ones. "He's a better writer than his speechwriters," said Adam Frankel, a senior Obama speechwriter from 2007 through 2012. "He's probably the most gifted writer in the White House since Lincoln or JFK." Unlike President John Kennedy's artistic style, which might have distracted from the underlying emotion in the message, Jamieson said, Obama's crafting has been so stealthy that listeners could be more easily moved by the speech's content. The 44th President approaches writing with "his own original, unencumbered style, free of conventional thinking," Frankel added. He captures "thoughts as distinctly as possible. Using phrasing that is appropriate to the occasion, but not typical." According to Obama's former writers, the process to create a speech usually goes like this: First, there's an initial conversation between the President and his top speechwriters. They discuss their target audience and what the message should be. Ultimately, they aim to tell a compelling story that people will remember. Next, Obama's chief speechwriter would talk with other writers about how to frame the story. For example, shortly after the 2016 election, chief speechwriter Keenan met with staffers to figure out how to write Obama's final address to the nation. This meeting was actually captured in the CNN Films' documentary First drafts would go through policy experts and back to the President for final edits or approval. Several weeks later, that meeting resulted in Obama's farewell address, "President Obama has always been better speaking to live, large crowds than he has been when speaking to audiences from the Oval Office," says Jamieson. The farewell speech ended up being "deeply optimistic at a time when Hillary Clinton's supporters are not. They needed to hear that optimism." Experts mentioned other standout examples of well-written Obama speeches, such as his Cairo address in Egypt when he reached out to the Muslim world ... ... and his "More Perfect Union" 2008 campaign speech about America's long rstruggle with racial issues. While some writers get "locked in flourish," said former Obama staff speechwriter Aneesh Raman, the President's writing style "is always pretty direct." During Raman's two years as a White House staff speechwriter, he didn't often meet with President Obama face to face. But the President did edit Raman's draft speeches and send them back with handwritten notes in black or blue ink. "When you get handed notes as a speechwriter you can fall victim to the illegibility of someone's handwriting - but his was always legible," said Raman, who now helps high school students raise college scholarship money "His handwriting is very small and neat," said Frankel. "His edits are extraordinarily precise. He may rewrite something the way he wants it and also restructure paragraphs that he thinks are out of order." President-elect Trump and his speechwriters are hammering out what will be one of the most important speeches of his -- every -- presidency: the inauguration speech. Lincoln and Kennedy are still remembered for theirs, so you know -- no pressure. If Jamieson could offer Trump a few tips for his inauguration speech, this is what she'd advise: xe2x80xa2 During the speech, identify principles that Americans all share, not ones that divide us. xe2x80xa2 Don't offer specific policy proposals (for example, don't get the audience to chant "Build a wall, Mexico will pay for it"). xe2x80xa2 Suppress all campaign tendencies and move into the persona of a president and elevate the audience. And about Trump's tweets: Jamieson recommends "falling silent for at least a day after inauguration, to let the address settle in." Not that speechwriters have any qualms with using the social platform. Obama's writers "We certainly saw this in President Obama's second term, there are more and more platforms and you have to be able to not just pick the right message but pick the right way to deliver that message" - whether it's a speech or a tweet. "You can say a lot in 140 characters," Jamieson suggested. "Use this format to be presidential. Mr. Trump, find a way to do that." "You can say a lot in 140 characters," Jamieson suggested. "Use this format to be presidential. Mr. Trump, find a way to do that." ©On the day Donald Trump is sworn in as president, a group of civil servants most people have never heard of will likely be running some of the country's most critical cabinet posts, at least temporarily. It's very unlikely that all or even most of Trump's cabinet nominees will be confirmed by the Senate Friday, but tradition means that the members of President Barack Obama's current cabinet all depart at noon, leaving many posts without permanent leaders on Day One of Trump's presidency. But that doesn't mean that no one will be in charge of the Pentagon, the Treasury, or State Department. While the Senate waits to confirm Trump's nominees, critical national security and economic posts will be led by designated acting secretaries and agency heads, like Norris Cochran who will lead the Department of Health and Human Services or Catherine McCabe at the Environmental Protection Agency. This is not unusual. When Obama took office on January 20, 2009, only eight cabinet secretaries were ready to take office and many posts remained vacant. While some like Secretary of State Hillary Clinton were confirmed the next day, Kathleen Sebelius, Obama's first HHS secretary, was not confirmed until April of that year. "You're not going to get the critical people in place in time," Max Stier, the president of the Partnership for Public Service, an organization that has been pushing reforms to the presidential transition process, told CNN. Stier noted that an incoming administration has to appoint some 4,000 political appointees, with about 1,100 of those requiring senate confirmation, a difficult process due to competing priorities, like legislation and judicial appointments. It's a situation he said was unique to the American system of government, calling it "a recipe for slowness, delay and inefficiency." The job of running the various departments during this gap period will be left to "acting" secretaries and agency heads, usually senior civil servants, many of whom have been in government for decades. How long the acting heads will sit atop their respective agencies will depend on how Trump's picks fare during their confirmation processes. Some of those, like retired Gen. James Mattis, are expected to be confirmed as early as Friday. But others, including the pick to run the State Department, Rex Tillerson, are facing more political opposition, casting doubt on whether or not they can receive a timely confirmation. Some of Trump's nominees, including his pick for labor secretary, aren't even due to receive hearings prior to inauguration, guaranteeing temporary leadership during at least the first days of Trump's presidency. The acting bureaucrats designated to handle the gap are likely to face unique leadership challenges as they try to manage departments and agencies during the early days of a new administration. "It's a bit of a gray zone," Barry Pavel, who worked for the senior executive service in the Pentagon during the Bill Clinton-Bush transition and for the National Security Council during the Bush-Obama transition, told CNN. Pavel, now of the Atlantic Council, said that while "there will be some anxiety" among the civil service during the transition period, "the people in the trenches, they're going to perform." Here's a look at who is poised to take over various government departments if the posts remain vacant: The Pentagon appears likely to have the most seamless transition. Mattis has already been granted a waiver that will permit him to serve in the role and the vote for his confirmation is expected Friday. In the unlikely event that the vote is derailed, the incoming administration has already decided to keep the current deputy defense secretary, Work, in place. And of course key military posts, including the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, will be unaffected by the transition. Democratic and some Republican opposition to Tillerson has raised questions on the timeline of his confirmation. Shannon is a career ambassador in the Foreign Service and former ambassador to Brazil. A Senior State Department official told CNN that Shannon is "fully, ready, willing, and able if it falls to him," but noted that the Trump team could designate another official farther down the line of succession should they prefer someone else. Trump's DHS nominee retired Gen. John Kelly, also appears headed for a relatively quick confirmation process, but should he not be confirmed immediately, Fulghum is the highest ranking non-political official that would serve as acting secretary, according to DHS spokesperson Todd Breasseale. Like Kelly, Fulghum is also a former military officer, having served 28 years in the Air Force, rising to the rank of colonel. Sen. Jeff Sessions has faced a grilling on Capitol Hill from the Senate Judiciary Committee and should his nomination be held up, Yates will run DOJ in the interim, by request of the Trump team. During the George W. Bush to Obama transition, Bush's deputy attorney general similar led the department while former Attorney General Eric Holder awaited confirmation in the Senate. Eight years earlier, Holder himself was held over briefly from the administration of former President Bill Clinton. Holder had been deputy attorney general in Clinton's second term and took the Justice Department helm for 12 days in early 2001 until Bush nominee John Ashcroft was confirmed. Trump's Interior nominee Rep. Ryan Zinke should not face too much of a fight in Congress, but until he is confirmed the department will be led by a relatively obscure official, Haugrud, according to the department's press secretary, Jessica Kershaw. Until Dr. Ben Carson is confirmed, HUD will be helmed by Clemmensen, according to HUD spokesman Jerry Brown. Clemmensen has held his position since 2010 and has more than two decades of experience at the department. McCabe will serve as acting administrator beginning on January 20, 2017, Julia Valentine, the acting director of the office of media relations at the agency told CNN. McCabe is currently the EPA Region 2 Deputy Administrator in New York City. McCabe has also worked on environmental law cases for the Justice Department for 22 years, so she could potentially find herself at odds with the incoming administration's priorities on the environment. Following Tom Vilsack's resignation last Friday, the USDA is already under the leadership of an interim secretary -- Michael Scuse, who most has served as the Farm and Foreign Agriculture Under Secretary since 2012. According to his bio on the department's website, Scuse is a lifelong Delaware farmer. He has been nominated to be Agriculture Secretary of Delaware, so it remains unclear how long he will hold onto the interim tag. Trump has not yet nominated someone for the USDA post. Rep. Mike Pompeo, Trump's pick to lead the agency, is another nominee that the Senate appears moving to confirm, but should that process be held-up, the executive director of the CIA, the third-highest ranking official and highest ranking non-political appointee, would serve as acting director. Representatives from the Commerce Department told CNN that while they had designated a potential acting secretary as part of the line of succession in accordance with the Vacancies Reform Act, they would not release that information at this time. Cochran has been designated the acting secretary. Trump's nominee, Rep. Tom Price, faces the first of what will be two difficult confirmation hearings Wednesday. Democrats are critical of Price's plans to revise the Affordable Care Act as well as financial investments Price made in medical companies. Trump's pick to lead the Education Department, Betsy DeVos, faced a grilling on Capitol Hill Wednesday and Rosenfelt will be serving as the acting secretary for the department until a new secretary is confirmed, according to a letter sent to employees from outgoing Secretary John King. Rosenfelt has served in his current role since 2006. Former Texas governor and incoming Energy Secretary Rick Perry has yet to even appear before a confirmation hearing, guaranteeing that the Department of Energy will be led by an acting secretary on day one of the Trump administration. An official at the energy department told CNN that Bochenek has been named as the interim acting secretary, adding that she is well positioned to serve in an acting capacity until the new secretary is sworn in. Prior to Energy, Bochenek spent over 25 years with the Department of Defense, where she served as chief technology officer of the US Army's Materiel Command. Huerta already has a major job leading the FAA, and will add to his responsibilities beginning January 20. Huerta has held his current role since 2013, and will effectively lead the entire Transportation Department until Trump's nominee, Elaine Chao, is confirmed.

Tom Price's stock transactions. The OGE tweets did not specifically cite Price, his financial holdings or the Senate hearing. The tweets came less than an hour after Price -- President-elect Donald Trump's nominee to be secretary of Health and Human Services -- defended himself against questions about his stock transactions at a Senate hearing and invoked the ethics office's approval. Under questioning about his investments, Price cited the Office of Government Ethics and its "diligence" in its role reviewing all Cabinet nominees' financial records. "We have agreed to every single recommendation that they've made to divest of whatever holdings we have that might even give the appearance of a possible conflict," Price said. CNN Price has said the stocks were purchased through a broker and that he did not know which stocks he owned. He repeated that he did nothing inappropriate and pointed to disclosures he made to OGE that were signed off on in the nomination process. The ethics office's tweets came shortly thereafter, with messages outlining what it does -- and doesn't -- do. "OGE's focus is prevention; IGs investigate potential misconduct & @TheJusticeDept prosecutes criminal violations," OGE "OGE oversees the executive branch #ethics program, while Congress & the Courts have their own ethics programs," they OGE did not comment on the tweets on the record. Though the tweet did not specially refer to Price, the OGE has tangled with the incoming Trump administration before. The office's Twitter account has been vocal in advocating for full divestment by President-elect Donald Trump, which Trump is not opting to do, and the chief of the office has been vocal about his concerns. An expert on ethics and former Federal Election Commission general counsel said Price's submission to OGE would not have been scrutinized for past actions. "The Office of Government ethics reviews his current situation for potential conflicts of interest and negotiates an agreement with how he should handle (divestment) in the future," Larry Noble, general counsel at the Campaign Legal Center, said about Price's testimony. "It does not look at his past activity." Noble also said that purchasing the stock through a broker alone wouldn't mean there are no ethical questions -- saying Price would need to assure he and the broker did not discuss the stock or the bill. "The fact of the matter is that I have had no conversations with my broker about any political activity at all other than her congratulating me on my election," Price said before the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy said that Price appeared to have invested in a number of drug companies before taking action to "inflate" those firms' values. "Why wouldn't you at least tell her, 'Listen, stay clear of any companies that are directly affected by my legislative work?'" Murphy asked. "Because the agreement that we have is that she'd provide a diversified portfolio, which is exactly what virtually every one of you have in your investment opportunities, and make certain that in order to protect one's assets, that there's a diversified arrangement for purchase of stocks," Price said. "I knew nothing about those purchases." ©Donald Trump's nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, Rep. Tom Price, defended himself from accusations of inappropriate financial investments Wednesday in a fiery four-hour hearing that exposed the congressman's political vulnerabilities. "Everything that we have done has been above-board, transparent, ethical and legal," Price told the Senate Health committee as Democrats grilled him over stock purchases that they said appeared to show that Price made financial gains from his work as a legislator. Price, an orthopedic surgeon, made his name in Washington as an ardent critic of Obamacare and authored among the most detailed legislation to dismantle President Barack Obama's landmark health care law. If confirmed, Price could play an outsized role in efforts to roll back major parts of the law -- a top legislative priority for Republicans under the Trump administration. But while Price fielded plenty of questions Wednesday about his views on reforming the health care system, it was his actions as an investor that sparked the tensest exchanges and seemed at times to leave the veteran lawmaker flustered. Right off the bat, Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Health Committee, grilled Price on whether he purchased stocks in a company called Innate Immunotherapeutics after receiving a "stock tip" from a fellow member of the House, GOP Rep. Chris Collins. "Do you believe it is appropriate for a senior member of Congress, actively involved in policymaking in the health center, to repeatedly personally invest in a drug company that could benefit from those actions?" Murray asked. "That's not what happened," said Price, who insisted repeatedly that he never received information that could be considered stock tip. Murray shot back: "I believe it's inappropriate. And we need answers to this." Later in the hearing, Price also said he has "no idea" what stocks he owns when Sen. Al Franken brought up congressman's prior holdings in tobacco companies. "How do you square reaping personal financial gains from sales of an addictive product that kills millions of Americans every decade with also voting against measures to reduce the death toll inflicted by tobacco?" Franken asked. The question was among the most antagonistic and personally hitting for Price, who had said earlier that his father had been a "Lucky Strike smoker from World War II" who died from emphysema. "I have no idea what stocks I held in the '90s or the 2000s or even now," Price said. "All of these decisions for all of us I suspect, are through mutual funds and through pension funds." One specific ethics concern raised during the hearing was Price's investment last year in a medical device manufacturer called Zimmer Biomet. Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren said it was hard to believe that Price's broker was simply someone "you pay to handle the paperwork." "This is someone who buys stock at your direction. This is someone who buys and sells the stocks you want them to buy and sell," Warren said. "Not true. That's not true senator," Price responded. "Just because you decide not to tell them? Wink, wink, nod, nod and we're all just supposed to believe that?" When Warren pressed Price further on whether he took deliberate action as a lawmaker to help the company, Price shot back that he was "offended by the insinuation." But while Price said he didn't know what stocks he previously owned, he maintained that he has divulged his and his wife's holdings every year and has updated it if there were any changes. "There isn't a single bit of information that's out here that I didn't reveal to the public in a transparent process," he said. Price also praised the Office of Government Ethics and the "diligence" of its review of cabinet nominees' holdings and assets. He noted that the office puts very specific recommendations online that the public can review. "We have agreed to every single recommendation that they've made to divest of whatever holdings we have that might even give the appearance of a possible conflict," Price said. Price was likely referring to the fact that Zimmer Biomet Holdings is listed in his financial disclosure and his ethics agreement as an asset for him to divest if confirmed to run HHS. The Office of Government Ethics, however, is tasked with reviewing Price's potential conflicts for his administration post, not his previous conduct. "The Office of Government ethics reviews his current situation for potential conflicts of interest and negotiates an agreement with how he should handle (divestment) in the future," Larry Noble, general counsel at the Campaign Legal Center, said about Price's testimony. "It does not look at his past activity." The ethics office also weighed, sending out a series of tweets soon after Price's testimony and clarifying its role: "OGE oversees the executive branch #ethics program, while Congress & the Courts have their own ethics programs.... OGE does not handle complaints of misconduct. Please learn where & how to report #fed employee misconduct," the agency wrote. Price, expected to be a key player in the GOP's effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, said Trump and Republicans must reassure the American people that "Nobody's interested in pulling the rug out from under anybody." "We believe that it's absolutely imperative that individuals that have healthcare be able to keep health coverage and move hopefully to greater choices and opportunities for them to gain the kind of coverage that they want," Price said. "There's been a lot of talk about individuals losing health coverage. That is not our goal, nor is it our desire nor is it our plan." Asked by Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tennessee, chairman of the health committee, about Trump's recent comments that repeal and replace should happen simultaneously, Price said he believes "that's fair." Price, however, has been kept out of the loop on Trump's Obamacare proposal so that he doesn't have to answer questions about the specifics of that plan, according to a Trump transition official. In his opening statement, Price emphasized his upbringing and professional background, including his 20 years as a practicing physician that he said helped him learn about "not just treating patients but about he broader health care system and where it intersects with government." But he did not mention his legislation to undo Obamacare during those introductory remarks, speaking instead in broad strokes about the country's health care system. Price said he believes in these six principles of health care: "Affordability, accessibility, quality, responsiveness, innovation and choices." GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch, along with other Republican senators, strongly defended his fellow lawmaker. Hatch called the accusations leveled against Price "nothing more than a hypocritical attack on your good character. And I personally resent it." This will be the first of two hearings for Price. He will also face the Senate Finance Committee on January 24. This will be the first of two hearings for Price.

More than 100 square blocks -- about 2.7 square miles -- will be Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said last week at a briefing from a suburban command and control center that an estimated 28,000 in personnel from the US Secret Service, Transportation Security Administration, FBI, US Park Police, US Capitol Police, Coast Guard and local police from Washington and around the nation would be fanned out across the city to provide multiple layers -- and dimensions -- of security. Despite the absence of a "specific, credible threat," Johnson told reporters the primary focus would be on "individual acts of violent extremism and those who self-radicalize," as have been seen in recent attacks in France and Germany. Dump trucks and buses will be placed in strategic locations to block off large gatherings of pedestrians. Johnson also estimated that a total of 99 both pro- and anti-Trump groups -- their plans gleaned via permit applications and social media surveillance -- would launch demonstrations over a period beginning Friday and carrying on through Saturday evening. The Women's March on Washington, which is drawing a vast coalition of anti-Trump groups, could draw upwards of 200,000 people on Saturday. Unseasonably warm temperatures are being forecast -- 51 degrees with evening showers on Friday and a high of 61 degrees on Saturday -- and should help groups reach their more optimistic turnout estimates.

Anticipating a flood of visitors, Amtrak too will Anticipating a flood of visitors, Amtrak too will ©Soon-to-be First Lady Melania Trump is considering a man among several other candidates to become the next White House social secretary, according to two people with knowledge of East Wing personnel deliberations. A final decision hasn't been made. The role has historically been filled by a woman until 2011, when the Obamas named Jeremy Bernard to the position, making him the first man and the first openly gay social secretary. The social secretary oversees state dinners, parties and public events typically held nearly every day at the White House and acts as a conduit between the first family and the residence staff. This candidate is not in their social circle in New York, according to a source with ties to the transition. "Mrs. Trump is not yet speaking publicly about key decisions she's making privately on personnel," according to a transition official working closely with the incoming first lady. The official said reports that the Office of the First Lady would be changing to the Office of the First Family are incorrect. "She will make the house a home for her family," the person said on the condition of anonymity. Melania Trump has said she will stay in New York while their ten-year-old son Barron finishes school there and she has made no announcement about when or if she will move to Washington. "We were prepared to have a man as the president's spouse," said Anita McBride, Laura Bush's former chief of staff. "There is no reason not to consider a man for the position of social secretary. It is an extraordinary opportunity." The social secretary reports to the first lady and the president but has the most interaction with the first lady. Desiree Rogers, the Obama's first social secretary, was named well before the inauguration in 2009 and was very involved in the family's move into the White House. She left fourteen months after the Obamas took office, in part because of controversy after two people managed to sneak into the first state dinner of the new administration. Rogers was the first African American social secretary and working for the first African American first family had special significance for her, specifically seeing the reaction of the mostly African American butlers staff. "On Inaugural Day what was most compelling to me is that I looked at all these gentlemen preparing for the arrival of the first African American president -- I could not help but be taken at how they looked," Rogers said in an interview for the book "The Residence: Inside the Private World of the White House." "They reminded me, quite frankly, of my grandfather, who obviously was a pillar in our family." In 2015, the Obamas named Deesha Dyer as social secretary to replace Bernard. Dyer had been an intern in the Office of Scheduling and Advance and became the second African American to fill the position. ©The Trump transition team for national security has been slow to interact with the Obama administration's National Security Council, according to a source close to the transition. NSC staff have written a series of briefing materials to bring the Trump team up to speed and there is uncertainty within the Obama administration on whether Trump's team have read them, the source said. One official said that the Trump team has "begun engaging at the staff level only recently." The same source said the challenges are being attributed to delays in the appointments of key staff and getting required security clearances. The New York Times was first to report this story. Obama's National Security Adviser, Susan Rice, told The Times that that it took "more time than we expected for them to be ready to engage with us" and that the White House was "racing to make up lost time." Rice emphasized to The Times that she was confident that the Trump administration would have what it needed by the inauguration on Friday. Trump transition spokesman Sean Spicer disagreed with any assessment that the transition team isn't prepared, telling reporters during a conference call on Wednesday that the incoming deputy national security adviser, KT McFarland, "has met with her counterpart countless times" and he added that "there's been readings of briefings that have been sent over." Spicer emphasized preparedness, saying, "Make no mistake: The landing teams are ready to go" and ready to start working on Inauguration Day, adding that he thinks the Trump transition plan "will become the gold standard moving forward." Several State Department officials have also described very little interaction with the Trump transition team. Although the department has produced dozens of briefing papers on various issues to prepare the incoming administration for the myriad foreign policy issues it will face, officials said they do not know if they have been read. The team has asked a lot of questions about budget and organization of the department, but officials said while there have been some discussions, there has not a robust dialogue about foreign policy. "They are still in receive mode," one official said. According to a State Department official, there is no expectation of any press briefings at the State Department next week because there is "no policy yet." Unlike previous transitions, the officials said they have no idea who will be serving at the State Department in the incoming administration. Rex Tillerson, President-elect Donald Trump's pick for Secretary of State, has not tapped a deputy or designated any staff that will be working with him, and no undersecretaries and assistant secretaries for the various regional bureaus -- typically among the first senior positions filled -- have been named.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi touted events organized by Democrats around the country to highlight support for President Barack Obama's signature health care law. "People are becoming outraged and speaking up," Pelosi said, and pointed to events in districts across the country in the last week that drew hundreds, or in some cases, thousands of people concerned about the fallout from the GOP pledge to dismantle the law. "Democrats will not sit idly by," Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland said, stressing, "every American should know they will be adversely affected if the Affordable Care Act is repealed." He pointed to the requirements that insurers can't deny anyone with a pre-existing condition, preventive care coverage, lifetime limits on out-of-pocket expenses, and other provisions apply to all those with health insurance. Taking a page from the Republican push in 2009 and 2010 to drum up opposition to Obamacare in town halls of vulnerable members of Congress, Democrats are creating a major public relations push to counter the GOP move to roll it back. Pelosi argued that effort is "organic" and that it's following on Americans living with the benefits of the law and increasing public support for the law that up until recently has been viewed poorly by a majority of voters since it was enacted. "This is different also because then, they were putting fear in people's minds about what this might do. Right now, they're trying to take away a benefit. It's a harder thing to do." But the California Democrat acknowledged that one thing her party failed to do in 2010 was combat the GOP's message on the law, saying, "If I would fault us with anything, it is not to stop doing the work we're doing and just fight their misrepresentations." Pelosi pointed to new polls "public opinion on this subject has grown. It's one thing for us to try and sell it to the American public, it's another thing for the Republicans to take it away." "This doesn't play in Peoria," Illinois Rep. Cheri Bustos told reporters, saying she held several events in her district on the issue. She said even though the majority in the area voted for Trump, they don't support repealing the health care law. Democrats stressed that all Americans -- whether they are enrolled in health care exchanges established by Obamacare or have insurance coverage through employer sponsored plans -- all have a stake in the debate. California Democratic Rep. Linda Sanchez reeled off statistics about tens of thousands of projected job losses in the home states of House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the incoming president that she said were directly related to any move to do away with Obamacare. "A lot of economic activity is generated by the growth in health care jobs yet we stand to lose all that if Republicans foolishly go ahead with their plan to repeal the ACA," Sanchez said.

Less than 24 hours before he is inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States, Trump told supporters at a luncheon at his Washington hotel Thursday that he is preparing to use the presidential pen to sign some "very meaningful" documents. "We will be signing some papers that will be very meaningful tomorrow right after the speech to get the show going," Trump said, according to cell phone video of his remarks during a closed press portion of the luncheon obtained by CNN. The remarks came hours after the President-elect's incoming White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said Trump is planning to sign a series of executive orders beginning Friday, though Spicer said Trump is "still working through which ones he wants to deal with tomorrow versus Monday or Tuesday." "The President-elect is continuing to get briefed on some of the orders he wants to do and the sequencing thereof," Spicer said. "I think you'll see some activity on both tomorrow, over the weekend and then Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday." Trump aides have said that Trump will sign ceremonial and logistical executive orders on Friday, but have also left the door open to more policy-oriented actions and announcements in Trump's first 12 hours in office. Advisers are preparing for announcements on a variety of fronts -- Friday, into the weekend and early next week -- whenever Trump gives the signal. Obamacare, the fight against ISIS, immigration and a lobbying ban are high on the list of early executive orders, Spicer said Thursday morning. A senior GOP Hill aide said lawmakers anticipate that Trump will roll out multiple executive orders related to Obamacare. But the stresses they have not yet been briefed or given any heads-up about what is coming. The President-elect had previously suggested that the work of his administration will begin in earnest on Monday -- and not before. "Day one -- which I will consider to be Monday as opposed to Friday or Saturday, right? I mean, my day one is going to be Monday because I don't want to be signing and get it mixed up with lots of celebration," Trump said in an interview with the UK's Times of London and Germany's Bild newspapers. Trump's advisers have sought to dispel that notion, with Spicer insisting repeatedly that Trump and his administration will hit the ground running on Friday after Trump is inaugurated at noon and work through the weekend. The moment Trump is sworn into office, some of his aides will start moving into the White House, Trump transition officials told CNN. Some of his advisers will even watch Trump deliver his inaugural address from inside the West Wing. The timing of executive orders is likely to be fluid. One adviser said executive orders or White House announcements could be put out in order to "change the conversation," in case anti-Trump protests or other rumblings steer attention away from Trump. Agency officials are likely to be no more informed of any executive actions as most Americans until they hit TV screens and news sites. One current administration official said Trump transition officials have not engaged with the Department of Health and Human Services about what heath care-related executive orders might fall. "I don't know what we're rolling out on Monday. Makes me a little nervous," the official, who has been through multiple transitions, said. Trump on the campaign trail vowed a flurry of action on his first day as president, including a pledge to "cancel immediately all illegal and overreaching executive orders." Trump also vowed he would impose a "moratorium on new agency regulations" across the federal government. During the campaign, the Republican frequently boasted that while he did not like Obama's executive orders, he would at least have the power to undo them as president. "If I get elected, many of those executive orders that he signed, the first day, they're going to be unsigned," Trump said in an interview with NBC's "Meet the Press" last January. "If I get elected, many of those executive orders that he signed, the first day, they're going to be unsigned," Trump said in an interview with NBC's "Meet the Press" last January. ©Donald Trump is still one day away from taking the oath of office. But on Capitol Hill, where Republican leaders have started the process of rolling back major parts of Obamacare and now face intense pressure to offer an alternative to the law as quickly as possible, the incoming president's thoughts on the matter have quickly become a political liability. Trump unexpectedly revealed over the weekend that his own plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act was nearing completion, and promised that it would provide "insurance for everybody" -- not to mention lower deductibles. Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, bristled at Trump's pledge to provide coverage for everyone, saying that it amounted to an overly ambitious promise. "It would be wonderful if we could do that. The problem is, is that you can't do it and make overpromises on everything," Hatch told CNN. "So we have to be very careful because there is a limit to what we can do." Sen. Lamar Alexander, the top Republican on the Senate Health Committee and another key player in the GOP's ongoing efforts to craft an Obamacare alternative, demurred when asked whether Trump's promise for universal coverage was realistic. "We'll just have to see what his plan is," Alexander said. "I thought that was a very interesting observation and I'm going to wait until I actually see his plan in February -- he may say other things between now and then." "It's being crafted right now," Pence said in an interview with CNN's Dana Bash, when asked about a replacement to the President's signature health care law. "We're getting very close. We expect to have that plan come forward in the early days of the administration." Democrats are more than happy to pit Trump's recent statements against GOP lawmakers. When GOP Rep. Tom Price, Trump's nominee for Health and Human Services secretary, testified before the Senate Health Committee on Wednesday, the panel's top Democrat, Sen. Patty Murray, asked Price to answer to Trump's words. "Just days ago, President-elect Trump promised 'insurance for everybody,'" Murray said. "But Congressman Price, your own proposals would cause millions of people to lose coverage, force many to pay more for their care, and leave people with pre-existing conditions vulnerable to insurance companies rejecting them or charging them more." Further frustrating GOP leaders is the fact that they have been kept out of the loop on the Trump transition team's Obamacare proposal. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn flatly answered "no" when asked this week whether he has been briefed by Trump officials. "I understand they are working on a plan, and we are eager to see it," Cornyn said. Most conservatives have long opted to use the term "access" rather than "coverage" -- a major fault line dividing Democrats and Republicans on the healthcare debate. To this end, Republican lawmakers have carefully avoided stating how many people could be covered under their revamped healthcare system -- a rule that Trump flatly broke in his comments over the weekend. GOP Sen. John Hoeven pivoted to emphasizing "access" when asked about the idea of providing healthcare coverage to everyone. "We want to make sure everyone has access to coverage and we want to make it more affordable," Hoeven told CNN. And Hoeven's colleague, Republican Sen. Rob Portman, appeared eager to lower expectations when pressed by CNN multiple times on Trump's comments. "I think we can do better than the current system, that's the point," Portman said.

Jim Clyburn, the top ranking African-American House Democrat, is attending Friday's inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump -- but he says his wife doesn't want him to go. Clyburn said his wife told him as he left home for the airport Thursday morning to head to Washington, "I understand you are going, but I want you to know that I don't like it." "We all have roles to play," Clyburn said, noting that he met Georgia Rep. John Lewis, a fellow civil rights activist who is boycotting the inauguration, in 1960. Roughly 60 House Democrats have said they won't attend the inauguration at the Capitol in part because they agree with Lewis' criticism of Trump. Last week, Lewis said he didn't believe Trump was a "legitimate president." "John's role in all of this is a bit different from mine," Clyburn said, noting he serves as part of the Democratic leadership team. But Clyburn didn't mince words when it comes to the feelings of African-American members in Congress about their concern about Trump's pick to lead the Justice Department. "You cannot possibly look at 49 members of the Congressional Black Caucus and say that I'm going to work with you guys but you've got to swallow Jeff Sessions as the US attorney general," Clyburn said. "That is absolutely crap." The South Carolina Democrat was willing to give his colleague, Republican Rep. Mick Mulvaney -- the nominee to lead the budget office for the Trump administration -- the benefit of the doubt about issues surrounding his failure to pay taxes. Clyburn noted his own family's experience running a business and managing tax payments. But he noted that then-President Bill Clinton's nominee to run the Department of Health and Human Services was forced to withdraw because of failure to pay taxes for a child care provider. "That's something he has to worry about," Clyburn said, noting he is disagrees with Mulvaney on most issues, but plays golf with him and wants to hear more about the situation. But Clyburn was more critical of the controversy surrounding stock trades, first reported by CNN, by Georgia Rep. Tom Price, who is the nominee to lead HHS. "Insider trading to me is a very, very serious to me -- that's much more serious to me than the oversight of payroll taxes," the third-ranking Democrat said.

It's a historical, yet astonishingly uncomfortable position for Rodriguez, 47, one of the leading religious advocates for Latino immigrants, who condemned Trump's hardline immigration rhetoric during the campaign, and saw Trump's words as direct threats and insults to the parishioners in his pews. "I went, what's going on?" Rodriguez told CNN at his Sacramento church. "Something's happening. I'm not here to justify what Donald Trump stated during the campaign. I do know there has been a change in tone." Rodriguez is referring to direct conversations with the Trump transition team. Rodriguez said days after the election, he and the 40,000 US churches he says he leads as the president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference, girded against the incoming administration. Hispanic evangelical leaders feared an "emptying out of our churches." Rodriguez, who had met face-to-face with Trump during the campaign, asked for an emergency conference call between Hispanic religious leaders and the transition team. In the call, Rodriguez asked directly: "Will you deport 12 million? The answer is explicitly no." The transition team assured the pastor the administration's focus would be on the undocumented immigrants who commit felonies, a position Rodriguez agrees with, and a policy pursued by the Obama administration. But he also feels strongly that the 700,000 children brought illegally to the US by their parents and now allowed to stay under President Barack Obama's executive action in 2012, must remain untouched. To that concern, he said the transition team said, "We're not going to harm those kids." Two hours after the conference call, explained Rodriguez, Trump sat down with Time Magazine and said of the so-called Dreamer children: "We're going to work something out that's going to make people happy and proud. They got brought here at a very young age, they've worked here, they've gone to school here. Some were good students. Some have wonderful jobs. And they're in never-never land because they don't know what's going to happen." "I believe he's committed to deporting people involved in nefarious activity. But I believe he's likewise committed to finding a pathway to legalization to the rest," Rodriguez said. The transition team call and the Trump team's public statements since were enough to convince Rodriguez to accept the invitation to the inauguration. Exit polls show about 30% of Hispanics voted for Donald Trump, despite the harsh and anti-Mexican rhetoric of his campaign. "It's a wake up call to both parties," Rodriguez said. "The Democratic Party has an issue with faith. If they have an issue with faith, they have an issue with the Latino community. We understand the pro-choice platform, but you can at least be nuanced with that, like President Obama." Obama also engaged in outreach in churches, explained Rodriguez, something he didn't see from the Clinton campaign. The sense he was left with was the Democrats had gone too secular. "Who do we vote for?" said Rodriguez, who engaged in a public, illness-inducing 40-day fast to urge comprehensive immigration reform. "I'm a Latino and I'm a Christian, so which one should I prioritize? Which one is more important?" On November 2, days before the election, Rodriguez spoke at a faith event still not endorsing a candidate. Instead, he asked evangelicals to focus on the platforms of the candidates. They would have to choose what issue, faith or identity, would determine their vote. The day after the election, Rodriguez awoke to mixed emotion. "My spirit celebrated the protection of my biblical beliefs. My soul began to worry for my people -- for immigrants," he said. To Republicans, Rodriguez said: "Don't blow it. If you actually dare act out the rhetoric of the campaign, it's political suicide. What you say is one thing, but what you do, by your fruit you shall be known. Let's see what happens. I'm open to being surprised." And if he's wrong? And the fears of deportation forces and separated families materializes as policy? Rodriguez said he will be the first to admit his errors and repent. But he lays the primary blame on the national political parties, who have failed again and again to pass comprehensive immigration reform. "Who would be at fault are Republicans and Democrats who have sacrificed the Latino and immigrant community at the altar of political expediency," he said.

The number falls far below the seven that Trump's transition had hoped for, which would match the number that President Barack Obama got approved on his first Inauguration Day. Retired Gens. James Mattis and John Kelly, nominated to run the Department of Defense and Department of Homeland Security, respectively, will likely be confirmed on Friday, Schumer told reporters. He said Democrats would also begin debate on the nominee to run the CIA, Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo, and he could be confirmed Friday or Monday depending on how long that process took. Schumer said some members of his caucus had "serious, serious statements they want to make about Pompeo" before voting on him. The New York Democrat also left open the door to some unnamed "noncontroversial" nominees getting approved Friday or Monday, but declined to say who he meant. While Republicans have a majority in the Senate and could confirm all of its nominees without Democratic support, Democrats can drag the process out for weeks if they are unhappy by requiring all procedural steps for each nominee. Throughout the news conference on Thursday, Schumer insisted Democrats weren't being obstructionist or playing politics, as accused by incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer earlier in the day. Schumer claimed several Republican nominees had "dramatic" ethical issues that needed to be fully vetted. "Very easy for the President-elect to solve it," Schumer said of the delay. "Tell everyone of his nominees to submit papers and give everyone ample time, a day or two, to question them" At the event, Schumer displayed two posters with the Democrats attack of "Swamp Cabinet" that laid out the top nominees of concern for the left: Office of Management and Budget nominee Rep. Mick Mulvaney; secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson; Environmental Protection Agency pick Scott Pruitt; health and human services nominee Rep. Tom Price; education pick Betsy DeVos; attorney general nominee Sen. Jeff Sessions; treasury choice Steve Mnuchin; and labor nominee Andrew Puzder. Two of those nominees are already facing scrutiny from some Republicans, as well. The GOP can only lose two caucus votes before they will need Democrats to help confirm nominees. Sen. Chuck Grassley, a top Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, warned Thursday that Trump's choice for budget director could face "problems" getting confirmed to the post because of his failure to pay taxes on a household employee. Mulvaney acknowledged to the committee that he did not pay taxes on a household employee for four years. He later paid back taxes when learning of the discrepancy, he said in a questionnaire that was submitted ahead of his confirmation hearing next week. Democrats seized on the news, saying such issues have forced candidates to withdraw from consideration in the past. Now it's not just Democrats -- Grassley a veteran Iowa Republican who sits on the panel, says similar tax flaps have caused problems for other Cabinet nominees in the past and could present fresh challenges for Mulvaney. "It could create problems," Grassley told CNN. "I don't know for sure, but I've had problems with former Cabinet people under both Republicans and Democrats where that's either been straightened out -- or if there wasn't justification for it oppose it." Grassley stopped short of saying whether Mulvaney should withdraw. A copy of the questionnaire obtained by CNN confirmed that Mulvaney informed the Senate Budget Committee that he repayed more than $15,000 in federal taxes on a "household employee." A source from Trump's transition team said Mulvaney had a "sitter" for his then-newborn triplets and was unaware he had to pay taxes on her income. Schumer on Thursday said the issue should disqualify Mulvaney -- citing the past example of President Barack Obama's Health and Human Services nominee of Tom Daschle, who withdrew for a similar issue. "Congressman Mulvaney failed to pay taxes on a household worker, the exact same issue that caused past nominees to withdraw," Schumer said, saying it was different than other confirmed nominees who had financial issues they may have not known about. Mulvaney says he was unaware of the error. The transition team defended Mulvaney, saying he was forthcoming. "The fact of the matter is that nobody is more qualified and more prepared to fight to rein in Washington spending and fight for taxpayers than Mick Mulvaney," transition spokesman John Czwartacki said in a statement. "Congressman Mulvaney raised the issue surrounding the care of his premature triplets immediately upon being tapped for this position, and has taken the appropriate follow-up measures." Schumer also targeted Tillerson, an Exxon Mobil CEO who has yet to win the support of Republicans and Russia hawks Sens. Marco Rubio, of Florida, and John McCain, of Arizona. But Schumer said Tillerson had "huge problems" beyond his past friendship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, citing Tillerson not pledging to recuse himself from any matter involving Exxon for the full duration of his tenure. "Oh no, there are serious problems with Rex Tillerson," Schumer said. "There'd be problems with having an oil magnate in general, but one who has been so unwilling to understand that his previous job and his future job will have conflicts of interest and he should try to be cleaner than Caesar's wife, he needs serious examination" "Oh no, there are serious problems with Rex Tillerson," Schumer said. "There'd be problems with having an oil magnate in general, but one who has been so unwilling to understand that his previous job and his future job will have conflicts of interest and he should try to be cleaner than Caesar's wife, he needs serious examination" ©"I'll never forget it," Clemie Burks said when asked to describe how she felt when Sen. Barack Obama took the oath of office on a frigid day in Washington. Nearly eight years later and 1,000 miles away in this Mississippi Delta town, Burks, a 57-year-old native seemed to swell with pride when she talked about her president, who would not be president much longer. "I was so proud. I think I jumped and hollered and cried and prayed and said, 'Ooh, we have finally made it,' she told me in a recent interview in her living room after she got off work from her nursing job, still dressed in her scrubs. "It's a day I never thought I would see." For Burks and many other African Americans, Obama's legacy is more than political -- it is personal, and gave them the ability to see themselves in places they never had before. That was especially true here in the Delta, where the DNA of this town reflects some of Mississippi's fraught history. Old railroad tracks divide the city in two, separating the predominantly black east side of the city from the more affluent, whiter west side. Last year, six decades after the US Supreme Court declared that "separate but equal" had no place in the nation's public schools, Still, people here are proud of their history. Sen. Robert Kennedy traveled here in 1967 to measure the effectiveness of the so-called War on Poverty. A nearby park is named for Amzie Moore, a local son turned civil rights leader. Dockery Plantation, just outside of Cleveland city limits, is the home of the famed singer Charley Patton and known around here as the birthplace of the blues. Over lunches and dinners, on the streets during a parade honoring the achievements of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., in churches and in classrooms, black residents of Cleveland counted down the final days of Obama's presidency with admiration and looked skeptically toward a future under President Trump. "The problem with Obama was he had so many challenges and they expected so much from him and he couldn't achieve everything they wanted him to achieve," Burks said. "Even in his trying -- and he failed in some of the things -- he's my giant." She is not alone. A recent Pew Research Center survey found that 62% of African Americans ranked Obama's election as the most significant historical event in their lifetime. Blacks from across the country flocked to DC in 2009 to see the nation's first black president sworn in. Willie Simmons, a Democratic state senator who owns a local homestyle restaurant was one of them. "It seemed like everybody in America either was there or wanted to be there," Simmons told me in an interview at The Senator's Place, the restaurant he's owned for more than two decades. Simmons described the change he felt happen when Obama was inaugurated; where there were once institutional barriers, there was now possibility. "Although the founding fathers basically said all men are created equal and indicated that we could become President of the United States if we wanted to, many of us never felt that we could," he said. "So to be able to be part of that celebration and watch Obama be sworn in as president is [a feeling] that you will never forget." Simmons wasn't always on team Obama though. During the 2008 primary, he supported Hillary Clinton because she believed she stood a better chance at winning, a decision that caused him to "lose a lot of friends" and be "jumped on by many." "One threatened to put me out of the family," he said with a laugh, alluding to a political rift between him and an older brother. "President Obama proved to us that a young community worker out of Chicago Illinois...could become president of the United States. In the future, we'll see another President Obama and we'll see a female become president of the United States also." The president himself sounded the same notes at his final presidential press conference this week. He was asked by April Ryan, the White House correspondent for American Urban Radio Network, whether he expected the country to see another black president. His answer? Not just black presidents, but all kinds of presidents. "I think we're going to see people of merit rise up from every race, faith, corner of this country. Because that's America's strength," he responded. "When we have everybody getting a chance and everybody's on the field, we end up being better." Later in the afternoon, The Senator's Place was filled with a throng of hungry black families, many in their Sunday finery after attending the day's Martin Luther King Day celebrations. A serpentine line of hungry folks wrapped around the perimeter of the restaurant as others chowed down from plates heaped high with fried chicken, turnip greens, candied yams and rice and gravy -- all for $8. One of them was Sassy Smith-Taylor, a 20-year old mass communications student at Mississippi Valley State University, a historically black college situated nearly 40 miles away in Itta Bena, Mississippi. Smith-Taylor grew up in Dallas but told me she was drawn to the small campus because of its tight-knit feel, something she said is emblematic of the entire Delta. "There is only one word that I think can describe the Mississippi Delta to the fullest extent and that's love," she said. "Every street...that you walk on has history to it. The college is about 15 miles down the highway from where Emmett Till was murdered, so there's a lot of hard history, but through all that, they still have the most positive people and the most loving people. You never meet a stranger." Smith-Taylor was just 12 years old when Obama was sworn into office and said she didn't initially realize the gravity of the moment. "I don't think it hit me, the impact he would have on our community as an African-American woman, and especially for our country as a whole," she recalled. "Being a kid, it let me know that not only can I have white friends and friends of different nationalities, but I'm also able to have the opportunity to become a president one day if I choose to." She described Obama's legacy of one of "hope, change and opportunity," but also said that the outgoing president faced unprecedented challenges while in office because he was a black man. She remembered when Rep. Joe Wilson, a white lawmaker, shouted "you lie!" during an address before a joint session of Congress. She recalled social media posts that referred to Obama's 2009 swearing-in as the "inniggeration," and political opponents who she believes have opposed Obama's policies simply because he is black. "The way he handled that with such class....he never fired back with mean or ugly jabs," she said. "He just continued...to strive to make this country as best as it could be." Obama gave many here in the Mississippi Delta a freedom to dream. But at the same time, the upcoming inauguration of President-elect Trump -- a man who at times seemed to run on a platform of that energized open racists -- seemed to replace the eight-year-old promise of "hope and change" with a mix of mistrust, anger and fear. "Expectations? I don't have any," Arlene Sanders, a professor at Delta State University said of Trump. "President-elect Trump says he's going to create jobs, improve the infrastructure. That was one of President Obama's goals...and Republicans didn't agree. Here, President-elect Trump says the same thing and everybody thinks it's such a bold new idea." She paused and pursed her lips. "Not expecting much, here in the heart of the Mississippi Delta." Smith-Taylor, the college student, wouldn't openly trash the incoming president, but suggested that some of his rhetoric surrounding blacks, Muslims and other people of color was troubling. She wanted to look forward. "The only way that you can go against some of the things that [Trump] has said and some of the things that he is done is to continue to show the world that, as Americans, we are not ugly. We do not hate one another," she said. "That's not what we do. America is love." Leroy Byars coached the football team at Cleveland's East Side High School for more than a decade before serving as the school's principal from 1988 to 1997. He's so revered that the school's football field bears his name. Now retired, Byars still lives in Cleveland, a place he says that has its "battles" but is still "one of the most opportune places to live." Byars predicted that under President-elect Trump, the country is in for a "rocky time." "Being a leader of a nation is a lot different from being a multi-millionaire and running your own business," he told me. "You're representing all the people of the United States of America. You have to act accordingly." I asked him if he thought Trump could represent people of color. "Some of the statements that he's made? I don't know," Byars said before pausing. "I have my doubts." Burks, the 57-year-old nurse, put it more bluntly: "[For] Trump to come behind Obama is a total disaster," she said flatly. "Trump is a fool." Trump, she said, sold voters in some parts of the country a false bill of goods. "We've just got a road ahead of us, a long road ahead of us. I'm hoping that we can change some things," she added later. "Sometimes, after 50 years and things haven't changed, sometimes you give up hope. But being a Christian, being a lady from the South, that's all we have...is Jesus." "We've just got a road ahead of us, a long road ahead of us.

"Our systems register over 500 million suspicious cyber events each day," NATO spokesperson Oana Lungescu told CNN Thursday. She added that in 2016, NATO was subjected to an average of 500 cyberattacks per month that merited some kind of response, "an increase of roughly 60% over 2015." "Foreign governments, criminals and terrorists can all be the source of cyberattacks, and attribution can be difficult," Lungescu said. "But of course, nations have the largest resources in the cyber field, and they are responsible for the majority of targeted attacks against NATO networks." President-elect Donald Trump called the military alliance obsolete in an interview with British and German media that was published on Sunday. "I said a long time ago that NATO had problems," Trump told them. "It was obsolete, because it was, you know, designed many, many years ago." But at the Davos Forum in Switzerland Thursday, NATO Secretary General emphasized the alliance's adaptability in the face of new threats like cyber. He noted that the alliance would respond to cyber-attacks in the same way that it would to a conventional assault, making cyber eligible for the invocation of NATO's mutual defense clause, Article V. In June, NATO opted to make cyber an official operational domain of warfare, along with air, sea and land. "We have decided that a cyberattack can trigger Article Five, meaning that (a) cyberattack can trigger a response from the whole alliance as a conventional armed attack," Stoltenberg said. "We are doing more when it comes to cyber defense because we have to understand that cyber-attacks can be as dangerous, as serious as armed attacks," he said. NATO officials have said that the alliance already faces daily attacks from a variety of hostile actors. Russia is widely believed to have the most sophisticated cyber capabilities among NATO's traditional adversaries. Stoltenberg's comments on cyber come amid increased concerns over security following the US intelligence community's findings that Russia directed cyber attacks against US electoral organizations. US officials have also warned that Russia may mount similar cyber campaigns against targets in Europe. Speaking at NATO headquarters in Belgium last week, the secretary general warned adversaries against meddling in elections. "We have seen reports about cyberattacks against many NATO allies and any attempt to intervene or to influence national elections from outside is unacceptable," he said. Throughout his appearance at Davos, Stoltenberg repeatedly touted the alliance's ability to respond and adapt to an ever-changing security environment, citing NATO's moves to bolster its eastern flank, fight terrorism in Afghanistan and respond to cyber. "NATO is the most successful military alliance in history because we have been able to adapt and will continue to adapt," Stoltenberg said.

Though a mostly mixed review overall, that's a sharp improvement compared with previous polling on the law. More have opposed than favored the law in every CNN/ORC poll on this question from March 2010 until now. The shift in the law's favor stems largely from Democrats and independents, while views among Republicans haven't moved much. Still, few feel the ACA has done much to help them personally. Just 22% say they or their families are better off since the law's provisions have gone into effect, and more, 30%, say that they are worse off now. About 3-in-10 say that the law hasn't actually helped anyone in the US, including 58% of Republicans who feel that way. The law undoubtedly helped reduce the share of uninsured Americans, with the uninsured rate reaching historic lows following the implementation of some parts of the law, but Americans by and large don't see it as successful. Almost 4-in-10 (37%) say they consider the law a failure, outnumbering the 23% who say they see the law as a success. That's an uptick since 2015, but nearly all of the increase in perceptions of the law as a success comes among Democrats, 46% of whom say so now, up from 19% in 2015. The incoming Trump administration and the Republican Congress that will accompany it have called repealing Obamacare a top priority, and health care generally has risen in priority in the eyes of Americans. In the new poll, 14% cited health care as the most important issue facing the country, up sharply from the 3% who cited it last fall in a similar question about the most important issue in the presidential campaign. Americans see repeal-and-replace as more likely to happen than any other Trump campaign promise tested in the poll, with 82% saying they think it's at least somewhat likely. Fewer think Trump is likely to follow through with another health care related promise, reducing prescription drug costs, 52% see that as likely to occur. Considering the process for repeal, a majority would prefer the GOP to repeal parts of the law only if replacements can be enacted at the same time (55%), including majorities of Republicans (58%) and independents (61%) and a plurality of Democrats (45%). Fewer overall say they ought to repeal parts of the law as they can, regardless of their ability to replace those pieces (21%) and another 1-in-5 (22%) say they'd prefer the Republicans to abandon their plans to repeal the law entirely. Americans have less confidence that Trump will be able to achieve another oft-stated goal: Draining the swamp. Almost 6-in-10, 58% say it's unlikely that Trump will be able to reduce corruption in Washington, a shift since November when a narrow majority thought he would be able to accomplish that. They are also doubtful that he will be able to avoid conflicts between his business and his work as president, with 55% calling that unlikely. The plan Trump has announced to turn over control of his business to his adult sons so far hasn't won over a skeptical public. Only about one-third (36%) say they think it does enough to eliminate conflicts of interest, 62% think it doesn't go far enough. Two-thirds think he hasn't disclosed enough information about his financial situation and business connections, and more, 74%, say Trump should release his tax returns, including 96% of Democrats, 71% of independents and 51% of Republicans. Still, one aspect of Trump's divestment plan appears to have appeal, 54% say they approve of his plan to donate to the U.S. Treasury Trump hotel profits earned from foreign governments. Considering the other Trump family members who have been in the news lately, 59% say it is inappropriate for Trump to have his daughter, Ivanka Trump, and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, working in the White House. Kushner has been appointed a senior advisor to the president and Ivanka Trump is expected to work there eventually. The Congress that will be working with the White House to enact Trump's agenda, begins his time in office with a 20% approval rating, that's a bit below the 29% approval they held at the start of Barack Obama's time in office, and about on-par with their standing in January 2013 ahead of Obama's second inauguration. Of the four party leaders heading up congressional caucuses in the House and Senate, House Speaker Paul Ryan has the highest favorability rating (46% view him favorably) and is best-known. Democratic House Leader Nancy Pelosi follows with 35% favorability. The two Senate leaders are both less well-known and less well-liked, with 25% holding a favorable opinion of new Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and 20% favorable toward Republican leader Mitch McConnell.

The announcement comes within 24 hours of the transfer of power from Obama to President-elect Donald Trump. A White House official told CNN this is Obama's final batch of clemency. The move brings the total number of individuals who sentences Obama reduced to a total of 1,715, including 568 who had been sentenced to life in prison. The large majority of sentences Obama commuted Thursday -- and in total -- were those that came from nonviolent drug offenses. If these are Obama's final acts of clemency that would apparently close the door on such an action for former American prisoner of war Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who has asked Obama for a pardon, Justice Department officials told CNN in December. Bergdahl faces charges for leaving his post in Afghanistan in 2009. His court-martial is scheduled for February 6. Trump has been a staunch critic of Bergdahl and the prisoner swap made under Obama. In 2014, Bergdahl was released after nearly five years in captivity by the Taliban in exchange five detainees at Guantanamo Bay. During the campaign, Trump frequently called Bergdahl a "traitor" and suggested that he should face harsher punishment. Earlier this week, Obama Obama has granted more commutations than any previous president, even surpassing the number of commutations granted by the past 13 presidents combined. "The President set out to reinvigorate clemency, and he has done just that," White House Counsel Neil Eggleston said Thursday. Eggleston said that those granted clemency under Obama were granted a second chance because "the President sees the potential in you." Many of those whose punishments he's reduced were incarcerated for crimes involving crack cocaine, which had with mandatory sentences that were longer than those for the drug's powdered version. The discrepancy -- a byproduct of the war on drugs -- overwhelmingly affected African-Americans. Obama had hoped for legislation to permanently end the disparities in sentencing laws. While an unlikely group of activists have pushed in Congress for a bill that would alter mandatory minimums and reform the prison system, no legislation passed from the effort. Instead, Obama encouraged Americans serving lengthy terms to apply for clemency, prompting a flood of applications to his Justice Department. A group of legal aid groups established the Clemency Project to help screen applicants and complete the required paperwork.

Thursday's transfer concludes the Obama administration's final push to empty the facility as much as possible prior to Friday's inauguration, with 19 inmates being transferred since Election Day. One of the inmates is going to Saudi Arabia and the other three are being taken in by the United Arab Emirates. There were 242 detainees at Guantanamo when Obama came into office in January 2009 and he had pledged to close the controversial center within one year in an executive order he signed shortly after his own inauguration. But in recent days, administration officials have acknowledged that this goal was out of reach. "I don't anticipate that we will succeed in that goal of closing the prison, but it's not for a lack of trying -- that, I assure you," White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Tuesday. Earnest blamed both Republicans and Democrats in Congress for the administration's failure to close the detention facility. "Because of the obstacles erected by Congress, terrorist organizations have a powerful recruiting tool, and millions in taxpayer dollars are wasted to operate this large facility," he said. President-elect Donald Trump will now come into office with responsibility for the remaining 41 prisoners. Four of the remaining inmates have undergone a security review process and are eligible for transfer. But their transfer, as well as any others, looks unlikely as Trump has slammed the most recent efforts to empty the prison, nicknamed Gitmo. "There should be no further releases from Gitmo. These are extremely dangerous people and should not be allowed back onto the battlefield," Trump tweeted on January 3, one of several statements about keeping the prison open. The prison's peak population was 684 detainees in June 2003. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which tracks recidivism among former inmates, said in a September report that nine of 161 inmates released since January 2009 had returned to supporting terrorist groups. An additional 11 are "suspected" of having gone back to terrorist activity, though the report notes that the Defense Intelligence Agency puts that number at 15.

"Before I leave my note for our 45th president, I wanted to say one final thank you for the honor of serving as your 44th," he wrote. "Because all that I've learned in my time in office, I've learned from you. You made me a better president, and you made me a better man." The President recalled tragedies such as the Charleston church massacre and celebrations such as military graduations. He also celebrated gay and lesbian Americans who now have their marriages recognized and ill people who now have access to health care. Obama went on to challenge voters -- regardless of political affiliation -- to commit themselves to improving the common good. "I've seen you, the American people, in all your decency, determination, good humor and kindness. And in your daily acts of citizenship, I've seen our future unfolding," he said. "All of us, regardless of party, should throw ourselves into that work -- the joyous work of citizenship. Not just when there's an election, not just when our own narrow interest is at stake, but over the full span of a lifetime." Obama has said he will remain engaged in issues he cares about in his post-White House life. "I'll be right there with you every step of the way," he wrote. "And when the arc of progress seems slow, remember: America is not the project of any one person. The single most powerful word in our democracy is the word 'We.' 'We the People.' 'We shall overcome.' " "Yes, we can," he added. "Yes, we can," he added. ©Donald Trump has arrived in Washington -- and he's going to be here for at least four years. The reality of the moment, that the real estate mogul and reality show star will recite the oath of office Friday, is finally taking hold. At noon Friday, the most divisive campaign in recent history -- and a similarly contentious transition period, marked by Trump's attacks on Rep. John Lewis, a civil rights icon, and dozens of House Democrats saying they'll boycott Trump's swearing-in over it -- reaches its end. Trump's But before all that, Republicans and Trump's still-growing staff are set for a celebration. Trump and Vice-President elect Mike Pence go through the ceremony at the Capitol at noon, followed by a parade up Pennsylvania Avenue -- and past Trump's new hotel -- to be followed by a weekend of balls and an anticipated flurry of new executive actions Monday. Speaking at a pre-inauguration concert Thursday night at the Lincoln Memorial, which featured performances by Lee Greenwood, Toby Keith and 3 Doors Down, Trump told the crowd he vowed to be a president "for all our people." "It's a movement like we've never seen anywhere in the world, they say. There's never been a movement like this. And it's something very, very special," Trump said. "And we're going to unify our country. And our phrase, you all know it -- half of you are wearing the hat, 'Make America great again.' But we're going to make America great for all our people, everybody. Everybody throughout our country. That includes the inner cities. That includes everybody." Later, speaking at a dinner held at Washington's Union Station, Trump thanked Pence, his top advisers and his family as he reflected on his election victory. "That was some big victory. That was some victory," said Trump, who also mused that "next time, we're going to win the old fashioned way," an apparent reference to victory in the popular vote as well as the Electoral College. Protesters and Washington police scuffled Thursday night outside a meeting of pro-Trump conservatives, the first of several demonstrations aimed at disrupting the new administration's inaugural weekend. Protesters gathered on 14th Street outside the National Press Club to demonstrate against "DeploraBall," an event organized by some of Trump's most fervent supporters. The name riffs off the campaign description of some Trump backers by his defeated opponent, Hillary Clinton, as a "basket of deplorables." As attendees -- some of whom were clad in suits and red hats, others dressed in gowns -- entered the event, demonstrators chanted "Shame" and "Nazis go home" behind a phalanx of police. Some held signs that read "No Alt Reich" and "No Nazi USA." Other protesters chanted against the "alt-right," "fascists" and "Nazi scum," though it could not be immediately determined who was attending the event. Some protesters could be seen setting small fires in the streets, though it was unclear what was set ablaze. A motorcycle was damaged on the street, and police could be seen pepper-spraying some protesters. Meanwhile, the transition of power -- from a Democratic president to a Republican one -- has shut down much of Washington and left its thousands of political staffers in quiet anticipation. At the same time, President Barack Obama's last boxes are being packed and his few remaining aides are preparing to move out as they enter their last moments hours of Obama's eight years in the White House. Obama is spending the last full day of his presidency in the White House on Thursday, where staffers are saying their wistful goodbyes. "After six years here, walking through these doors for the final time," White House deputy press secretary Eric Schultz tweeted. Outgoing White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest tweeted his thanks to the press corps. "It's been an honor to serve. And to all those fighting for a better future, I'll see you on the other side. Thanks," he wrote. All around them, Washington is hustling to prepare for Trump's swearing-in on the steps of the Capitol. Barricades are up all around the Capitol building and traffic has ground to a halt through downtown Washington, as the Secret Service restricts access to an event where the President-elect, outgoing President, much of Congress and the Supreme Court will be on-hand. DC workers are also navigating around the closures of five Metro stops -- Mount Vernon Square, Archives, Federal Triangle, Smithsonian and the Pentagon. Out-of-towners are streaming into Washington hotels, and small protests are popping up day and night around the Capitol complex. One unexpected bit of inauguration-week drama: Questions over whether the National Park Service would set aside its ban on umbrellas, with rain forecast for Friday's inauguration. The decision: Long umbrellas still won't be allowed. But attendees can bring small, collapsible umbrellas. On Capitol Hill, members of the Senate are gearing up for an immediate battle over confirming Trump's Cabinet picks. About seven nominees may receive confirmation votes Friday afternoon, after Trump's inauguration, while Democrats are already looking to draw out the process with some of the picks, like secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson and HHS nominee Tom Price. Obama held his final news conference Wednesday -- and his final interview was with a podcast run by a group of former aides, Tommy Vietor, Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett and Dan Pfeiffer. In his final news conference, Obama offered an optimistic message as his party prepares to watch Republicans reverse many of its accomplishments from his tenure in office. "It is true that behind closed doors, I curse more than I do publicly, and sometimes I get mad and frustrated like everybody else does," Obama said. "But at my core, I think we're going to be OK. We just have to fight for it, we have to work for it and not take it for granted." After Trump's inauguration, Obama and his family will depart on one last presidential plane ride -- to a vacation in Palm Springs, California. They'll travel back on their own.

They'll travel back on their own. ©Some members in the federal workforce are voicing concerns about the incoming Trump administration's readiness to assume control of the federal bureaucracy on Friday, citing unread transition memos, vacant administration posts and a host of appointees with scant government experience. Staffers at the most senior levels, including in the White House and at federal agencies, have met with their incoming counterparts. Deeper into the hierarchy, however, there's been little contact between the staffers currently operating the levers of government and the team who takes over when President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in at noon on January 20. "I don't think they are ready for prime-time," said a longtime Obama administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe concerns about the state of the transition. "They are not ready," said a Republican who is close to Trump's transition. Deep differences over policy and tone have divided the incoming and outgoing administrations for months, but both sides have insisted that political differences would not prevent a smooth hand off of power. Indeed, the Obama and Trump teams have made shows of cooperation, including last week when top members of Trump's incoming Cabinet and White House staff participated in tabletop exercises with Obama's team. But officials at the White House and federal agencies who have been preparing for months to hand off memos with detailed instructions on presidential logistics and navigating the federal bureaucracy say there's no one in place to deliver their documents to -- and have little faith those people will be named by Friday. At a White House function Monday for Obama aides who have served for all eight years of the administration, senior officials were heard wondering aloud whether to expect any contact from the Trump administration before they packed their desks and vacated their offices. "People running major offices in the White House currently have had no contact with their successors," said one person who attended the function. "It is stunning. And we always kept thinking they're going to have a plan, they're going to come through at the last minute. We're less than 48 hours away. This should be concerning to anyone." Trump's national security transition team has been slow to interact with the Obama administration's National Security Council, according to a source close to the transition, who cited delays in the appointments of key staff and getting required security clearances. NSC staff have written a series of briefing materials to bring the Trump team up to speed and there is uncertainty within the Obama administration on whether Trump's team have read them, the source said. Trump's transition on Wednesday downplayed any suggestion the transition was lagging behind. "The level and comprehensive nature by which this transition has conducted itself will become the gold standard going forward, because it's not just the nominees and the prep and the White House staff, but it's the level of continuity of government, and peaceful transfer of power, that we have concentrated on," said Sean Spicer, Trump's incoming White House Press Secretary, on Wednesday. "I would just give a shout out to the Obama administration," he said. "President Obama, Mrs. Obama, Denis McDonough, and their various counterparts, especially on the White House staff, have been really gracious with their time and their support on the logistical nature to make sure that we have the support that we need." Marine Corps Gen. Joe Dunford also had reassuring comments Wednesday. "We talked about the state and nonstate challenges we have [and] spoke about our priorities we've had in our national military strategy," Dunford said of his transition team discussions, according to DoD News. According to a person close to the transition, Trump's new administration does have beachhead teams prepared to walk into each agency on Friday when Trump is sworn in. These teams range in size, from one to 30 people, and are staff-level jobs, which don't require Senate confirmation. Technically temporary presidential appointments, at least some of those hires are expected to become permanent once the administration gets fully up and running. But the transition source conceded Wednesday that beyond the Cabinet level posts, the top tiers of leadership in various federal departments remain largely unknown. Republicans who have observed the transition at close range describe a stalled hiring process after Chris Christie, the New Jersey governor, was ousted from his role leading the transition team shortly following November's election. Some of those Republicans complain the President-elect and his closest advisers placed too great an emphasis early in the process on barring those in the party who had disavowed Trump during the campaign -- many of whom had experience working in past Republican administrations. Current administration officials and wary Republicans alike were relieved when Trump named Joe Hagin, a veteran of George W. Bush's White House, to the key post of deputy chief of staff for operations. The move places an experienced hand in charge of the complicated world of presidential logistics. But, say current and former administration officials, one person alone can't be expected to manage the complex and deeply engrained system of running the executive branch. Those officials said that presidential scheduling, bookkeeping, document flow, and travel is a deeply complex system that requires a modicum of knowledge at all staff levels in order to prevent major disruptions in services. Managing a president's day-to-day schedule involves deep coordination both with the Secret Service and the US military, which handles the president's meals, his aircraft, his secure communication equipment, and his medical care. Trump has named government outsiders to the roles responsible for organizing his logistics, including appointing his former head of security as director of Oval Office operations. Another area of concern cited by an official: paper flow, a mundane but vital function of any White House. The White House releases thousands of documents yearly that have been approved by the president, many continuing obscure programs already in place. "Let one piece of paperwork get lost and suddenly a whole set of sanctions is lifted," one official warned. Trump, like past presidents, will work through a staff secretary to manage paper flow and circulate important documents among his senior staff. A name hasn't officially been put forward by Trump's transition team, but reports have pegged Rob Porter, Sen. Orrin Hatch's chief of staff, as Trump's pick. President Barack Obama named a staff secretary in November 2008, shortly after he was elected. Questions over the Trump team's preparation for office have even trickled to the East Wing, where permanent staff -- some of them preparing to work for their sixth president -- are awaiting marching orders. Unlike his predecessors, Trump hasn't named a decorator to assist in redesigning and personalizing his private living quarters and the Oval Office. The National Gallery of Art, which has lent artwork to White Houses dating back decades, say they haven't received any requests from Trump or his team. Meanwhile, the selection of 20th Century art the Obamas used to decorate their own living quarters has been returned.

At least two DC police officers and one other person were taken to the hospital after run-ins with protesters, DC Fire Spokesman Vito Maggiolo told CNN. Acting DC Police Chief Peter Newsham said the officers' injuries were considered minor and not life threatening. Bursts of chaos erupted on 12th and K streets as black-clad "antifascist" protesters smashed storefronts and bus stops, hammered out the windows of a limousine and eventually launched rocks at a phalanx of police lined up in an eastbound crosswalk. Officers responded by launching smoke and flash-bang devices, which could be heard from blocks away, into the street to disperse the crowds. "Pepper spray and other control devices were used to control the criminal actors and protect persons and property," police said. Anti-Trump protests also broke out Friday in US cities, including New York, Seattle, Dallas, Chicago and Portland, Oregon. Authorities in Seattle say one person was in critical condition at a hospital with a gunshot wound. Demonstrations also took place overseas in Hong Kong, Berlin and London. In Washington, Newsham told CNN the several hundred demonstrators who actively confronted police were vastly outnumbered by the thousands of nonviolent protesters who swarmed the nation's capital for Inauguration Day and Saturday's Women's March on Washington. "We have been pointing out all along that this is a very isolated incident, and by and large, everything is going peacefully and a lot of folks have come to the city to enjoy this historic day, not only the Capitol but walking all around the city," he said. But many protesters, including permitted marchers, accused security personnel of denying them access to their planned routes. Ashley Link, 37, made her way to Franklin Square after an ANSWER Coalition protest slated for the Navy Memorial on Pennsylvania Avenue, about a mile away, was effectively blocked by what many there described as onerous security restrictions. She expressed concern that isolated clashes with police would overshadow other messages on display, but sympathized with the rowdier elements in the street. "I'm all about peaceful protesting, practicing nonviolence, but at the same time, I understand why people are so frustrated," she said. "They are so upset about so many things in our country right now that to make a poster? There's not a poster big enough to cover all the things that people are frustrated about." Hours earlier, Lysander Reid-Powell, a 20-year-old student from New Mexico, joined in a Black Lives Matter-led blockade of an entrance onto the National Mall. "I think Donald Trump is a fascist, and it's very easy for people, especially people who are in pain, to slip into fascism," he said. "It's easy for people to feel like the individual has no power and that you're just one small little ant in the big hill, so ultimately all that matters is popular resistance." As Trump supporters and other spectators began to emerge from their hotels, many in the new president's signature red caps, and head for the security checkpoints on Friday morning, protesters at multiple entry points sought to cut off access by staging coordinated sit-ins. As the swearing-in ceremony neared around noon, hundreds of people remained snarled in long lines. Three women were chained together at the neck on 10th Street, and more than 150 DisruptJ20 demonstrators surrounded an entrance near the Canadian embassy. "This checkpoint is closed," they chanted, forcing Trump supporters to turn back and walk along Indiana Avenue in search of a clearer path. An assortment of "pop up" protests also lined the streets surrounding the secure zones on the mall. "We're here to take a stand against the ideas that Trump spouted throughout the course of this campaign -- sexism, Islamophobia, his bigotry and nationalism," said protester Jed Holtz, from New York City. The protests did not stop at the checkpoints. A half-dozen members of "Democracy Spring," a group that agitates against the influence of money in politics, obtained tickets that placed them within shouting distance of the swearing-in ceremony. As Trump stepped forward to to take the oath of office, six protesters, each wearing a letter of the word "RESIST," stood up to chant the preamble to US Constitution. Their shouting made it difficult for those seated nearby -- including former campaign staffers and volunteers, as well as Trump's ex-wife Ivana Trump -- to hear Trump utter the words that officially made him the 45th President of the United States. The disruption was compounded when, much as it happened at Trump's campaign rallies, his supporters responded, erupting in shouts of "Trump, Trump, Trump!" as they tried to drown out the interlopers. Liberal groups praised the work of protesters, many of whom traveled from around the country to rail against a president they called "illegitimate" in thousands of signs and songs. "The only source of light on this miserable day is the massive, multi-racial, multi-generational progressive resistance movement led by women and people of color that's already emerging to confront Donald Trump's agenda of hate and growing stronger every single day," Democracy for America Executive Director Charles Chamberlain said in a statement following the inaugural ceremony. In New York, nine people were arrested for disorderly conduct, according to the New York Police Department. Authorities said five people were arrested at a protest in Dallas, six in Chicago. In Portland, Oregon, protesters were armed with clubs, sticks and throwing unknown liquid at officers, according to the Portland Police Department. Six people were arrested in Portland Friday, Portland Police Sgt. Pete Simpson tells CNN. In Seattle, people threw bricks and other items at officers during a demonstration on the the University of Washington campus, city police said. Harborview Medical Center in Seattle confirmed it was treating a man who was shot at the protest and is in critical condition. Seattle police said a man turned himself in to campus police and was being questioned. The anti-Trump protests extended well beyond water's edge, with rallies popping up in Australia, London, Hong Kong and Berlin -- where demonstrators held a sign that read, "Walls divide." In the West Bank, Palestinians protested against Israeli settlements and Trump's plan to move the US Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. In Sydney, anti-Trump protesters and Trump supporters spilled into the city's streets Saturday to protest the US President. Thousands of people attended a Women's March in Martin Place in the central part of the city. Event organizers claimed nearly 5,000 people attended the march, but Sydney police estimate that the number was closer to 3,000. Chants from the crowd included "women united will never be defeated" and "when women's rights are under attack, what do we do, stand up fight back." A separate, smaller protest of approximately 30 people, in support of Trump also took place at Martin Place on Saturday. The pro-Trump crowd waved US and confederate flags in the air and shouted: "It's all over lefty scum" and "drain the swamp," witness to the protest Eliza Berlage told CNN. Some Trump enthusiast also carried placards saying "Aussies for Trump," Berlage said. The police refrained the pro-Trump protesters from going into the area with the anti-Trump protesters. Scuffles ensued as police tried to physically restrain some of the rally goers, Berlage said. On Thursday night in Washington, protesters gathered on 14th Street outside the National Press Club to demonstrate against "DeploraBall," an event organized by some of Trump's most aggressive online supporters. The name riffs off the campaign description of some Trump backers by his defeated opponent, Hillary Clinton, as a "basket of deplorables." As attendees -- some of whom were clad in suits and red hats, others dressed in gowns -- entered the event, demonstrators chanted "Shame" and "Nazis go home" behind a phalanx of police. Some held signs that read "No Alt Reich" and "No Nazi USA." On Saturday, the "We're really trying to set a tone of resistance for the coming years," Lacy MacAuley, a According to Department of Homeland Security chief Jeh Johnson, as many as 900,000 spectators may attend inaugural ceremonies. Johnson told reporters last week that 28,000 security personnel from dozens of agencies, including local and out-of-town police officers, will be fanned out across the city on Inauguration Day and into the weekend. Organizers of the march, which begins near Capitol Hill at 10 a.m. ET, now say internal divisions, many of them stemming from a divisive Democratic primary fight, are being put aside in the name of solidarity. "We have already proven that Hillary and Bernie Sanders supporters can work together against fascism, xenophobia, and racism," Linda Sarsour, a Palestinian-American Muslim activist from Brooklyn, told CNN. The march, which began with There are more than 600 "sister marches" planned around the country and fundraising for the event has largely come in chunks of $20 and $30 online donations. "It really reminds me of the Sanders campaign," Sarsour said. "A very grassroots, very grass-powered movement." "It really reminds me of the Sanders campaign," Sarsour said. "A very grassroots, very grass-powered movement." ©A pastor with a long history of inflammatory remarks about Muslims, Mormons, Catholics and gays preached at a private service for President-elect Trump and his family on Friday, shortly before Trump took the oath of office. The pastor, the Rev. Robert Jeffress, is a Southern Baptist who vigorously campaigned for Trump during the final months of the presidential election and is a member of his Friday morning's worship service, held at St. John's Episcopal Church across the street from the White House, continued a modern Inauguration Day ritual. With the exception of Richard Nixon in 1973, Usually the Inauguration Day service draws little notice, much less controversy. But offering Jeffress such a prominent pulpit is likely to irk religious minorities, particularly Muslims, many of whom were already angered by the President-elect's stoking of suspicions about Islam during the campaign. Jeffress leads a 12,000-member megachurch in Dallas and is a frequent guest on Fox News. But to many Americans, he may be best known for his frequent condemnations of Mormonism as a "cult" during the 2012 presidential campaign. He urged Christians not to vote for Mitt Romney, a Mormon, during the Republican primary. He later supported Romney over President Barack Obama. Jeffress has also called Islam and Mormonism heresies In recent years, Jeffress has frequently denounced Islam, calling it an "evil religion" that " The Rev. Luis Lexc3xb3n, rector of St. John's Episcopal, told CNN about the plan for Jeffress to deliver the sermon when CNN inquired about the event. Leon has been involved in logistical planning of the event but not the choice of speakers. About 300 people attended the private event, including Trump's family and Vice President-elect Mike Pence and his family. Trump's inauguration organizers chose Jeffress to preach, said Lexc3xb3n. On Fox News on Thursday night, Jeffress said his sermon centers on Nehemiah, a Trump-like figure from the Hebrew Bible, who helped rebuild Jerusalem in the 5th century BC, in part by mounting a defensive wall around the city. "I'm going to use Nehemiah's story as an example of why God blesses leaders," Jeffress said, "and I want it to be a tremendous encouragement to our great new president and vice president." An official affiliated with Trump inauguration planning, speaking on background, defended Jeffress against critics who call him divisive: "Pastor Jeffress is a unifying figure representing a diverse spectrum of Americans. Any attempt to vilify this religious leader is deeply disappointing and misplaced." The Council on American-Islamic relations disagreed. "Unfortunately, the choice of Rev. Jeffress is symptomatic of the incoming Trump administration's inclusion of notorious Islamophobes in the transition team, in the picks for cabinet nominees and, beginning Friday, in the White House," said CAIR spokesman Ibrahim Hooper. Ross Murray, director of programs for GLAAD, said he is also concerned about the inclusion of Jeffress in Friday's service. "The inauguration and the people invited to pray at the inauguration speak to the values and the agenda of the incoming president. Jeffress' anti-LGBTQ message is now going to be tied to this administration and its policies." Ironically, St. John's is known for its tolerance toward homosexuality and other faiths. In November, Lexc3xb3n joined other Episcopalians in urging Trump to denounce a rash of hate crimes across the US, many apparently related to the election. Even though the service was private, Jeffress is an unusual choice to preach on Inauguration Day, an occasion when incoming presidents often try to unite the country's diverse religious and social strands. In 2013, the Rev. According to Leon, other participants in Friday's service at St. John's are a mix of old-guard evangelicals and Trump loyalists. They include: Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr., Focus on the Family founder James Dobson, televangelist James Robison and Pastor Mark Burns, who has admitted to Later on Friday, at the inauguration itself, five Christians and one rabbi will offer public prayers and readings. While two of the pastors are prosperity preachers -- Jeffress' beliefs about other faiths -- that they are heresies and will not result in salvation -- are shared by many evangelicals. But the stridency of his condemnations sometimes confound fellow conservatives. "His sound bites are often incendiary, but his convictions - including the exclusivity of the gospel and the belief that homosexual behaviors are sinful - are clearly within the mainstream of American evangelicalism," R. Albert Mohler, a leading Southern Baptist, But Jeffress' denunciations of gays and Muslims often stretch beyond the realms of sin and salvation. He has called homosexuality "degrading," and In a Likewise, Jeffress has said that Islam incites violence and is "inspired by Satan himself," while also arguing that On occasion, Jeffress has taken aim at evangelicals themselves. "I am getting sick and tired of these namby-pamby, pantywaisted, weak-kneed Christians who say they're going to stay home (on Election Day) in November out of moral principle," On January 3, Jeffress tweeted that he had met with the incoming president in Trump Tower, and predicted he will be "the most faith-friendly president in our nation's history."

Everything from federal prosecutors to safety regulators to members of the Railroad Retirement Board. Even a handful of To help illuminate the sheer scope of a president's stamp on the federal workforce, we took more than 1,700 positions that are directly classified as "Presidential Appointments" in the government's bible of transition jobs, the The above result is an early-stage visualization for you to explore. (Over the coming weeks, we plan to build out much more sophisticated interactives to help you understand who is appointed within the new administration.) For now, you'll see a series of circles above, each sized based on the number of appointed jobs. The outermost circles are the agencies themselves, within them are the specific offices. Hover over or touch each circle for details, and click on one to zoom in. There actually are even more jobs beyond the higher-level ones represented above. That includes most notably what are known as "Schedule C" appointments -- more than 1,500 people at mid-level positions who range from policy experts to special advisers to schedulers. Those people are generally chosen by Trump's direct presidential appointees. Additionally, there's a federal job category known as the Senior Executive Service, which consists of thousands of upper-level managers. Most are career civil servants, but the president gets to appoint up to 10 percent of those slots as well. Of the 1,700 people represented here, the departments of Justice and State outweigh other agencies in terms of Senate-confirmed slots Trump will fill. That's largely because at DOJ -- 223 positions -- presidents get to choose every US attorney nationwide, along with the head of each office for the US Marshals. At State -- 269 positions -- the list includes all of the US ambassadors posted around the world. Other agencies with double-digit numbers of appointments include large departments such as But is also includes ones you may not have thought much about: roughly two dozen jobs at the National Endowment for the Humanities, about a dozen at both the US Postal Service and the American Battle Monuments Commission, as well as eight of nine board members of the Broadcasting Board of Governors. Safety regulation is one area where Trump appointees could potentially shift policy once five to ten top spots each are filled at places like the National Transportation Safety Board, Consumer Product Safety Commission, Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board, Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Workplace issues that affect millions of Americans could also see potential changes, depending on who Trump decides to appoint to agencies like the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, National Labor Relations Board or National Council on Disability. Then there are more obscure agencies with specific, but influential regional missions: the Farm Credit Administration. The Great Lakes Fishery Commission. The Appalachian Regional Commission. The Marine Mammal Commission. When it comes to who doesn't need Senate confirmation, it's not surprising the highest concentration is within the White House itself. Trump gets to appoint 129 individuals on his own to the Executive Office of the President, while only 22 require Senate approval. There are other federal entities which also are overwhelmingly appointed without Senate approval. All but one appointment to the Securities and Exchange commission are done without confirmation (though no more than three commissioners can be from the same party), as are all but one appointee at the Library of Congress. Other agencies that primarily have appointments without Senate approval include the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, the Commission on Civil Rights, the Arctic Research Commission, and the Committee for Purchase from People who are Blind or Severely Disabled. (Some of those positions have terms that expire in a staggered fashion over the next couple of years.) He will also appoint several dozen members of the US Holocaust Memorial Council when their five-year terms come open again. Just days before he left office, President Obama appointed For a campaign that at times expressed He can also name the director of the Bureau of Justice Statistics at DOJ, which does not require Senate confirmation. A professed Other climate-related roles within the president's Executive Office include the Special Assistant for Climate Preparedness and Deputy Assistant to the President for Energy and Climate Change. For refugees, Trump has one Senate-confirmed position, the State Department's Assistant Secretary of State for Population, Refugees, and Migration. There are other refugee appointments that fall under the broader categories of noncareer appointees not shown above, such as at the Department of Health and Human Services, where he'll name the both director and deputy director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement.

More to come in the weeks ahead. ©Donald Trump will enter the White House this week accompanied by a throng of advisers with equal authority and, often, warring worldviews. It's a structure old hands in Washington warn is bound to lead to chaos in the West Wing. Prior presidents have relied on their chief of staff to run the show in the White House. But Trump has anointed his, Reince Priebus, with the same authority and access as senior adviser and counselor Steve Bannon. They'll be joined in the White House by Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, and Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner. All four will have easy access to Trump in the oval office. And they're all but certain to take opposing views on major issues -- a dynamic that played out during Trump's presidential campaign and is expected to carry over to his administration. The arrangement offers an early look at Trump's preferred management structure: Competing power centers and conflicting viewpoints that, in Trump's eye, means the strongest proposal wins, according to advisers. It's a format that helped him soar in business and win the presidency in stunning fashion. Now, Trump is trying to apply it to the unwieldy bureaucracy of Washington. "He likes contrary views, arguing views. He thinks that generates creative thinking. Look at the way he does his companies; look at the way he did The Apprentice," said Richard Hohlt, a GOP consultant in Washington. "The question is can you manage it or do you allow that to gridlock you?" As Trump sought to build his cabinet, some of his senior advisers privately touted that the president-elect was looking to build a "team of rivals." In recent weeks they've sought to tone down that narrative, calling his cabinet picks "doers" and "disruptors." Whatever the nomenclature, it hardly changes the fact that Trump is building an administration ripe with internal competition. "This guy wants people to fight," one Trump adviser bluntly put it. "Because it's worked for him for 40 years." In the Trump administration, the various power centers will extend beyond his inner circle. On security issues, the president-elect tapped Tom Bossert to be his homeland security adviser -- and elevated the post so it holds the same stature as national security adviser, a role filled by retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn. On trade, Trump's top economic issue, at least three top advisers plan to play key roles in crafting new trade policies. They include Trump's pick for Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross, Peter Navarro, who will head the National Trade Council and Robert Lighthizer, the pick for US trade representative. It's a setup staffers privately admit is ripe for turf wars. The warnings from White House veterans are even stronger. "There is absolutely no comparison between running a real estate business and branding operation and running the government of the United States. The stakes are exponentially higher. The complexity is exponentially greater," said David Axelrod, a CNN political commentator who served as a senior adviser in President Obama's White House. "I think he's in for a rude awakening if he thinks he can run this like the Trump Organization," Axelrod said. A muddled chain of command, differing worldviews and staff spats can cost a fortune in business and wreak havoc on a campaign, but in an administration the negative outcomes are far more severe -- particularly on issues of national security, multiple White House veterans cautioned. In his final news conference Wednesday, President Barack Obama said he personally told Trump "this is a job of such magnitude that you can't do it by yourself. You are enormously reliant on a team." For Trump, that could present a unique challenge. The president-elect feeds on competition and looks favorably on his lieutenants that are willing to fight fiercely for their ideas, advisers said. He prefers crisp, succinct briefings and believes a battle of viewpoints yields the best outcome. Sean Spicer, Trump's spokesman, said, "His goal has been to get the best and brightest individuals together, present their ideas and make a decision based on the best and most persuasive arguments." One transition official minimized the potential for conflict, noting that even when Trump's top aides aren't in sync, they try to fight their battles ahead of time. Then, they present a plan to Trump. In reality, the President-elect is often swayed by the last person he's spoken to, which is part of the reason his top advisers are so keen to travel with him. Above all, Trump sees himself as the ultimate decider. But his first attempts at flexing that power already blindsided his allies on Capitol Hill when he surprised them with policy proclamations on healthcare and tax reform. Meanwhile, some of Trump's cabinet nominees have already broken publicly with their new boss during the confirmation process -- rifts that Trump and his allies are downplaying. "I told them, 'Be yourselves and say what you wanna say. Don't worry about me,'" Trump recently told reporters at Trump Tower. "I'm going to do the right thing, whatever it is." Retired Gen. James Mattis, Trump's pick for defense secretary, advocated for a national security team with diverse viewpoints during his confirmation hearing, while assuring senators that even as a four-star general he'd have no problem reporting to three-star Gen. Flynn. "You don't want the tyranny of consensus of group think early," Mattis said, noting the cabinet has been compared to a team of rivals. "It's actually healthy. It's not tidy. It'll be respectful, of that I'm certain, and Idon't anticipate that anything but the best ideas will win, sir." As Trump sought to build his administration, the President-elect often passed over candidates with the most impressive resumes for those he felt personally in-sync with, at least in style if not in substance. It's an approach he's long advocated. "Save yourself time by getting the best people you can," Trump wrote in his 2004 book, How to Get Rich. "Sometimes this can mean choosing attitude over experience and credentials. Use your creativity to come up with a good mix." Trump's mix of advisers often includes people who bear no titles. Throughout the campaign he was known to ask members -- and even employees -- of Mar-a-Lago to weigh in on issues he was wrestling with. "I do my own surveys and draw my own conclusions," Trump wrote in "The Art of the Deal." "I'm a great believer in asking everyone for an opinion before I make a decision. It's a natural reflex." One senior transition official said Trump's camps of influence are sprawling. They include his formal advisers, family, other politicians, business associates and sports figures and celebrities. Contrasting opinions aren't guaranteed to breed chaos. Obama appeared to nudge Trump to choose a team he trusts -- but not a circle of yes-men. The outgoing president offered this advice to Trump Wednesday: "if you haven't created a process that is fact-checking and probing and asking hard questions about policies or promises that you've made, that's when you start making mistakes," Obama said in his final press conference Wednesday. "Reality has a way of biting back if you're not paying attention to it." Even Trump is aware that a team that can't deliver results simply can't last. "You can't con people, at least not for long. You can create excitement, you can do wonderful promotion and get all kinds of press, and you can throw in a little hyperbole," Trump wrote in "The Art of the Deal." "But if you don't deliver the goods, people will eventually catch on." "You can't con people, at least not for long. You can create excitement, you can do wonderful promotion and get all kinds of press, and you can throw in a little hyperbole," Trump wrote in "The Art of the Deal." "But if you don't deliver the goods, people will eventually catch on." ©President-elect Donald Trump suggested to an audience on Thursday that he has a good sense of who he plans to nominate to the Supreme Court. "I think in my mind I know who it is," he said at a leadership luncheon at his hotel in downtown Washington, according to cell phone video of the event obtained by CNN. "I think you're going to be very, very excited." Trump said he would be submitting a name from a list of 20 that he put out during the campaign. "I put out the list of 20, all highly responsible and highly talented, very talented judges ... Replacing somebody that was somebody I had great respect for as an intellect, Justice (Antonin) Scalia," Trump said. The announcement will come "within two to three" weeks after the start of his administration," he said. Judge William H. Pryor and Judge Diane Sykes are widely considered at the top of his list, largely because Trump brought their names up during the campaign. Thursday's luncheon was briefly open to the press; Trump's comments regarding the Supreme Court justice came after pool reporters were led out of the room. Trump also met briefly Thursday at Blair House with Chief Justice John Roberts, who will administer the oath of office Friday.

Ron Wyden of Oregon, a Democratic member of the Senate Intelligence Committee and a vocal privacy advocate, has formally objected to the Senate voting Friday on CIA director nominee Instead, the source said, the Pompeo vote would likely be pushed back until Monday, after senators critical of Pompeo's confirmation have time to vocalize their concerns during debate on the floor. An official familiar with the visit says Trump intended to visit the CIA Saturday to meet with staff and attend Mike Pompeo's swearing-in. But now that Pompeo's confirmation vote has shifted potentially to Monday, the visit is in question. Earlier Thursday, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer signaled a vote on Pompeo might get pushed back to Monday because some of his caucus had "serious, serious statements they want to make about Pompeo" before voting for him. Pompeo was one of the three national security cabinet members Trump and Senate Republicans hoped to confirm Friday. Defense secretary nominee Ret. Gen. James Mattis and homeland security secretary Ret. Gen. John Kelly are expected to be confirmed, according to Schumer. Some other non-controversial cabinet nominees could get through too but aides and senators say negotiations over the nominations are likely to continue until Friday at 4 p.m. when the Senate convenes next to vote on the cabinet posts. Wyden was joined by multiple other Democratic senators in objecting to a swift vote, the source said. Republicans strongly warned Democrats against preventing Trump from getting his core national security team in place on day one, especially with the constant threat of terrorism around the world and in the US. They even suggested debating and voting Friday instead of waiting until Monday. Wyden is concerned about Pompeo's views expressed in a January 3, 2016, Wall Street Journal op-ed that should resume the collection of metadata to protect against terrorism. "Congress should pass a law re-establishing collection of all metadata, and combining it with publicly available financial and lifestyle information into a comprehensive, searchable database. Legal and bureaucratic impediments to surveillance should be removed," Pompeo wrote at the time. Wyden raised his concerns during Pompeo's confirmation hearing but was not satisfied with the nominee's responses. Wyden also talked about his concerns Thursday when he told reporters the Senate needed "a little bit of time to examine" Pompeo's surveillance proposals. "Mike Pompeo is proposing a brand new system of collecting an enormous amount of data on Americans, law abiding Americans, including life-style information, I think that's the kind of thing that you ought to take a little bit of time to examine," Wyden said.

Not one bit. The 45th President of the United States blazed onto the campaign trail more than a year ago with a message that stunned the Washington establishment. He was going to be a pure populist. He promised to give voice to "forgotten Americans." He said he would restore wealth to a middle class left behind in the economic resurgence. There was no explicit embrace of Republican values, no clear ideological bent -- only a vow to reshape government to serve the "tens of millions" of frustrated Americans who rose up to support his campaign. He rebuked the "small group in our nation's capital" that "has reaped the rewards the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost." "What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people," Trump said. "January 20th, 2017 will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again." "The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer," he said. "Everyone is listening to you now." Though he did not explicitly reach out to Americans who didn't vote for him, he did say he viewed his oath as "an oath of allegiance to all Americans." "At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other," Trump said. "When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice. ...A new national pride will stir our souls, lift our sights and heal our divisions." He also made repeated calls for unity, as well as compassion for "mothers and children trapped in poverty in inner cities," Americans affected by "shuttered factories" that "have left our shores," and people impacted by crime, gangs and drugs "that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential." "This American carnage stops right here and stops right now," he said to cheers. Like his speech at the Republican National Convention, Trump portrayed a dark vision of a nation in deep distress, ignoring traditional metrics like the dip to 4.7% unemployment under Obama's eight years in office. But he expressed hope and optimism about the change he could be able to bring to Washington, pronouncing that the time for "empty talk" from politicians was over and the "hour of action" had arrived. While he did not go into great detail about his agenda, he promised to fix "decaying" infrastructure and outlined a marked turn inward to an "America First" policy that would govern all of his actions on trade and global affairs. In a preview of the retrenchment from the role of America's policeman that was such a strong theme under President George W. Bush, Trump spoke of trillions of dollars "wasted overseas" while American roads and bridges fell into disrepair. "We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams," he said. After months of biting Tweets, sharp criticism of the opposition party, and threats of immigration crackdowns that have sent fear coursing through minority communities across the nation, Trump dialed back his more controversial instincts on the day he put his hand on Abraham Lincoln's Bible to take the oath of office. It marked a rare moment where the most unconventional presidential candidate of modern times was swept up in the storied traditions that accompany the peaceful transfer of power that is so uniquely American. Trump's supporters, who had traveled to Washington from all over the country, hailed the speech as a moment of vindication. "I feel wonderful," said Harold Sexton, a 49-year-old construction superindent from Kenton, Ohio. "I'm very hopeful for the future. Just what he promised to bring the American people: more jobs, better trade, drain the swamp." James King, a 68-year-old crane operator from Fredericksburg, Virginia, said he was "thrilled beyond belief." "We have an opportunity for change," he said. "Whether it happens or not we don't know, but we have the opportunity." Still, Trump's more restrained speech, the strains of "Hail to the Chief" and the traditional 21-gun salute that ushered Trump into office, could not mask what is a historical moment of deep divisions and tensions in America. On Saturday, some hundreds of thousands of women are expected to descend on Washington to march in protest of Trump's agenda and past remarks, which they view as sexist, misogynistic and disrespectful. Scattered protests against Trump also erupted around the city on Friday, even as Washington was under heavy guard from police with temporary metal walls that stretched for miles. Trump faces stark challenges in the days ahead. Other presidents have stepped into the role after a honeymoon period that serves as a helpful launching pad for their first 100 days. Trump, by contrast, is mired in historic lows that are on par with the dismal numbers that other presidents have faced when they left office. Just 40% of adult Americans said they approved of Trump's handling of the transition in a CNN/ORC poll released this week, the lowest of any recent president. By comparison, Obama had an 84% approval rating when he took office in 2009, 67% approved of Bill Clinton and 61% approved of George W. Bush shortly before he took office in 2001 after a fierce and lengthy recount. Trump also starts his administration under a cloud of uncertainty. He has vowed to repeal Obamacare at the time when it has reached the height of its popularity. Womens' groups fear that the administration's plans to defund women's health funding around the world. And the administration has not ruled out the possibility of Trump signing a pile of executive orders that would unravel Obama's actions. On a more granular level, most of Trump's 21 Cabinet-level nominees have not been confirmed by the Senate and there are hundreds of key jobs still to be filled in the administration. Trump tweaked Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in brief remarks during the formal luncheon at the Capitol following his inaugural address, signaling his eagerness to get his nominees through. And he recognized his election rival, Hillary Clinton, prompting a standing ovation. Beyond top Cabinet jobs, transition officials acknowledge that they have filled few jobs in the leadership tier below the cabinet level -- the deputy secretaries who form the management structure of each federal agency. In order to keep the government functioning, the Trump team has assembled 536 "beachhead team members" to fill empty posts in various federal agencies today. They range in number from one to 30 people for different agencies, according to a Trump transition aide. It's unclear however, how much power the temporary, staff-level aides will have at a time when few senior officials are in place. And it remains to be seen how Trump intends to address complaints about the lack of diversity in his cabinet. For the first time since the 1980s, the group of cabinet appointees does not include a single Hispanic-American. Sean Spicer, Trump's new White House press secretary, pushed back on questions about Trump's commitment to diversity Thursday. "I think when you look at the totality of his administration - the people that he's talked to, the people that he's met with, the people that he is appointing -- you see a president who is committed to uniting this country, who's brining the best and the brightest together," he said. Spicer said ultimately Americans will focus on diversity in gender, thinking and ideology: "It's not just about, you know, skin color or ethnic heritage." Trump echoed those thoughts in his speech Friday, stating that he would welcome differences in opinion and philosophies. "We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity," Trump said. "When America is united, America is totally unstoppable." ©Over Joe Biden's 44 years in public office, the former vice president says he made roughly 8,000 round trips between his home state of Delaware and Washington DC -- or 2.1 million miles. Today, he left Washington on a one-way ticket. The avuncular Biden, with a wide grin on his face, boarded Amtrak train #2166 at Union Station, bound for the station named in his honor: Joseph R. Biden, Jr. Railroad Station. "Back on Amtrak," Biden exclaimed as he boarded. Amtrak is part of who Biden is. After losing his wife and daughter in a car accident in 1972, Biden rode the rails to and from Washington nearly every day to help raise his sons, Hunter and Beau. He continued the practice even over the last eight years as vice president, becoming the rail system's biggest proponent on Capitol Hill. "This is my family and this is why I wanted to go home the way I came," Biden told CNN as the train moved between Washington and Baltimore. Listening in on the interview, Dr. Jill Biden, whom Biden married in 1977, chimed in, "It's full circle." "Full circle," the former vice president said in agreement. "I'm going home to Delaware, the people I owe. And I really do owe them." For as much as Friday's ride home was business as usual for the former vice president, the 135-mile ride was life changing for Biden. Theoretically, Biden's departure was giving way for a convective takeover of Washington. President Donald Trump, a man Biden had suggested he wanted to beat up as a candidate, was moving into the White House. Mike Pence, a social conservative with views diametrically opposed to what Biden has advocated throughout his career, was moving into the vice president's residence. But more practically, Biden's departure kicked off the slow transition to a semi-normal life. Secret Service protection will soon dissipate for Biden, and the former vice president will transition to splitting time between the University of Pennsylvania for work on foreign policy and the University of Delaware for domestic policy work. Biden will no longer be vice president and the differences will be obvious. After the vice president boarded the train on Friday, a ticket taker made her way through the cabin. Biden's ticket had his name scrawled across the front, a departure from the last eight years. According to Amtrak's vice president of operations, Biden has ridden the rails for the last eight years on an anonymous reservation for security reasons. With security less of a priority, Friday was the first time in eight years his ticket actually bore his name. Biden will still spend time in Washington. Jill Biden will continue to teach at Northern Virginia Community College and the couple is looking to rent a house in the area, aides said. That means more time on the train and more time for Biden to reflect on the people he passes by. "What I used to do, literally, is you ride along here at night going home and you look out, you look in the windows and you see the lights on and think about, I mean this sincerely, what is going on at that kitchen table," Biden said about his travel on Amtrak. "What are people thinking about, what are there real worries?" Biden said he plans on staying engaged and will keep in touch with former President Barack Obama. His last words to the former president, Biden said, were, "I'll see you in a couple of weeks." "I know it sounds corny, but we are close friends," Biden said. As the train pulled into Wilmington, the conductor broke with protocol and read out the entire name of the station: Joseph R. Biden Jr. Railroad Station. Biden's cabin cheered when his name was read and the former vice president smiled. The real surprise, though, came when Biden made his way down into the Wilmington train station. There, Biden was joined by many of his friends, former aides and the University of Delaware marching band. "Whoa," Biden said. Some of his top aides were even surprised at the welcoming party. Biden has become synonymous with Delaware and he has wore the state on his sleeve throughout his career. After the heroes welcome and a short trip across town to the Chase Center, Biden was greeted by hundreds of people who had come to welcome him home. Dozens of Amtrak and Wilmington police stood at attention as Biden drove by. "This is overwhelming for Jill and me," he said with the pained look on his face of a man trying and failing to hold back tears. "We never, and I mean this sincerely, we never thought we left home." Biden barely pulled himself back together before losing it again, "When I die, Delaware will be written on my heart." Biden's voice broke as he thanked the audience. Near the end of his speech, Biden welcomed his entire extended family up on stage, including his grandchildren Natalie and Hunter, the daughter and son of Beau Biden, whose death in 2015 rocked the vice president. Biden recovered, aides said, in part because of the love he found from people around him in Delaware. "You have been with me in victory," Biden said near the close of his speech and, in effect, vice presidency. "You've been with me in defeat. You have all stayed with me."

"It's too early to tell," the New York Democrat told CNN's Chris Cuomo on "New Day" on Friday. "This Cabinet selection has been a disaster for the president. We call it the swamp Cabinet." Schumer said that the nominees have values that are inconsistent with those of the man who nominated them. "More conflicts of interest than you have ever seen," he said. "People whose positions are fundamentally different than President-elect Trump's." Schumer said that even though "these Cabinet nominees need scrutiny," his Senate Republican colleagues "have tried to rush them through." He complained that some nominees had not fully completed the paperwork required by the ethics office in a timely fashion -- citing education secretary nominee Betsy DeVos. "You're required by law to file an ethics report and how do you get rid of your conflicts of interests? Ms. Devos, controversial secretary of education nominee, didn't file any papers and they put her on at 5 o'clock at night," he said. "Each senator only got five minutes of questions." But Schumer did have some positive comments about a few of Trump's picks. "There are some not controversial. We're not opposing for their own sake," he said. "I think (retired Gen. James) Mattis is a good choice for defense secretary. We'll vote on him this afternoon." "I think (retired Gen. John) Kelly is a great choice for homeland security. We'll put him up today and (Rep. Mike) Pompeo for CIA, which is a little bit more controversial ... but if he's not voted on today, he will be Monday," Schumer said. Schumer defended the amount of time senators have spent grilling other nominees. "To spend a few days on people as controversial as (Rep. Tom) Price or Devos or (Labor secretary nominee Andrew) Puzder, who's so been against the working man and woman -- to take a few days in power for four years, tremendous say over the lives of ordinary Americans, of course that's what we should do," he said.

Mike Pompeo on Friday as CIA director, Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer is urging the Trump administration to keep John Brennan in the top intelligence job until Monday. However, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's office said hours later it had been formally informed that Brennan and the deputy director have resigned, underscoring Republicans' desire for Pompeo to be confirmed Friday. Schumer had asked Vice President-elect Mike Pence to keep Brennan on, according to a Schumer aide. Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, R-North Carolina, accused Schumer of breaking an agreement to confirm Pompeo on Friday. "We had a deal with Schumer but apparently he's broken that," Burr told CNN. As he headed into McConnell's office for a pre-inaugural meeting to discuss the issue, Burr said he had agreed to a Democratic request to change by one day the Intelligence Committee's confirmation hearing for Pompeo in exchange for Schumer's word that Pompeo would be voted on by the Senate on Inauguration Day. But a senior Senate Democratic aide disputed that was agreed to by Schumer and said the Pompeo hearing was moved from Wednesday to accommodate Democratic senators who were stretched thin between multiple confirmation hearings that same day. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, a member of the Intelligence Committee, was overheard in a Capitol corridor informing several other GOP senators about the issue and firing them up to fight Schumer. "I hope we'll stay in session for as long as it takes to get Rep. Pompeo confirmed," Cotton said in an interview a few minutes later. Democrats argued that a CIA director had never been confirmed on Inauguration Day before and Pompeo has controversial views on surveillance and other issues that should be debated on the floor. "There are some serious questions as to what Pompeo is gong to do at the CIA," said Sen Chris Murphy, D-Connecticut. "We ought to be able to have a debate on the Senate floor." The comments come as the GOP is planning a major push to get more Trump nominees confirmed soon -- with Sen. John Cornyn of Texas advocating for all-night, all-weekend sessions to get at least five more nominees confirmed.

It's hard to gauge crowd sizes and the National Park Service, which oversees the National Mall, doesn't offer estimates of any sort. But the side-by-side images of Friday's ceremony alongside the 2009 inauguration of President Barack Obama show a significantly smaller crowd on the National Mall for Trump than for Obama. There is empty ground exposed in the Trump photos. The same spots were almost entirely covered eight years ago, when estimates at the time suggested 1.8 million people attended the inauguration. The images above do not capture people who might have viewed from the west side of the Washington monument. And there are some differences. The grass on the mall is covered in white plastic for Trump's inauguration, but not for Obama's. The photo of Trump's inauguration was taken from television during his speech - peak time for the crowd. The photo of Obama's inauguration was taken by Getty and doesn't indicate the time, but Trump's should represent his largest audience. When President Obama took the oath of office in 2009, conditions were clear with temperatures were in the 20s. Eight years later, temperatures hovered in the high 40s with intermittent rain. Another sign attendance for Trump's inauguration could be lower: Metro ridership. Per WMATA, the Washington area transit authority, as of 11 am, 193,000 trips had been taken on the city's subway system. At the same hour in 2009, that number was 513,000, according to WMATA. The same time for the second Obama inauguration saw 317,000 riders, and President George W. Bush's second inauguration saw 197,000 riders by 11 am.

The 45th President signed a bill passed by Congress earlier this month that would allow retired Gen. James Mattis to serve as defense secretary by waiving the legal requirement that he be out of the military for seven years before doing so, according to White House press secretary Sean Spicer. Mattis will still need to be confirmed by the Senate, which is expected Friday afternoon. Cameras rolled as Trump signed his first orders as President in the Capitol, surrounded by congressional leaders. According to Spicer, the other papers Trump was signing included formal nominations for his Cabinet and a proclamation for a national day of patriotism. The ceremony took place moments after Trump left the podium outside the Capitol building where he was sworn in and delivered his inaugural address. As is customary, Trump used a series of pens to sign the measures, then distributed the pens among the people gathered. Presidential signing pens are regularly given out as commemorative gifts to politicians or individuals touched by the action. The moment played out on live television as Trump offered his first pen to the Democrats around him, first House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and then Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who hails from New York and has long known Trump. The mood was jovial, as Trump, surrounded by family, joked with congressional leaders. He, Pelosi and Schumer talked about trading pens as Pelosi remarked that hers came from the nominating papers of Georgia Rep. Tom Price. Price, up for Health and Human Services, is being strongly opposed by Democrats, who have attacked him on policy and called for an investigation into some of his stock trades, which Price defended before the Senate committee holding his confirmation hearing this week. Trump offered Pelosi the pen from the paper he was signing instead, that of transportation secretary nominee Elaine Chao. Pelosi demurred, with Trump giving the pen to Chao's husband, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. The Senate will begin voting on Trump's Cabinet on Friday afternoon, but is only expected to confirm two nominees that day -- Mattis and retired Gen. John Kelly, up for Homeland Security. The remaining nominees are expected to receive debate, hearings and votes in coming days.

"We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world, but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first," Trump told the crowd as a light rain fell. "We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs," Trump said. "Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength," he added. The President reprised his populist campaign themes, invoking a vision of American decline in the world and signaling changes to long-standing US foreign policy that few of his Cabinet nominees and officials have publicly echoed. Trump's election rhetoric rattled many allies, and there was little in his inaugural address to reassure US partners or to put foes on notice that the US intends to stand up for its friends and democratic values. He made no reference to America's traditional role as a global leader and shaper of international norms. Instead, he pointed at withdrawal -- a prospect that many foreign policy analysts warn could create a vacuum that China or Russia will move to fill. "We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to follow," Trump said. Instead, Trump framed US economic struggles as a result of policies oriented toward other countries. "For many decades, we've enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry, subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military," Trump said. "We've defended other nation's borders while refusing to defend our own and spent trillions of dollars overseas while America's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay," he added. "We've made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has disappeared over the horizon." The speech echoed his campaign stances, in which Trump blamed China for stealing American jobs, accused allies such as NATO and Gulf countries of taking advantage of US largesse and called for building a wall along the border with Mexico. As a candidate, Trump had proposed rewriting international trade deals and reconsidering alliances that have underpinned the international security order since World War II. As Trump addressed the inaugural crowd, the White House website posted his "America First" foreign policy -- a phrase he emphasized in his speech. The phrase "America First" is a loaded one, rooted in the years leading up to World War II when a group of that name urged Congress to stay out of the conflict. Historians today see the group that first used that name as isolationist, defeatist and anti-Semitic. The 537-word foreign policy statement didn't offer any more details than Trump provided during the campaign, devoting more space to trade issues than traditional national security matters. The document stated that the US will withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a massive trade proposal that President Barack Obama championed, and renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. If Canada and Mexico refuse to do so, "then the President will give notice of the United States' intent to withdraw from NAFTA." The US will also crack down on nations that violate trade deals and "harm American workers in the process." Trump will tell his commerce secretary "to use every tool at the federal government's disposal to end these abuses," it added. Trump's position on trade is at odds with standard Republican pro-trade views and indeed, he differs with them -- and even his own Cabinet members -- on many aspects of national security. Trump's prospective secretary of state, retired ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, diverged from Trump as he described Russia as a "danger," affirmed his belief in climate change and said he supported the TPP in his confirmation hearings. The President's designated ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, supports sanctions on Russia, which Trump has suggested easing. While Trump has dismissed the UN as a "club" for people who like a good time, Haley said "the UN matters." And she said there is no place for a registry of Americans based on religion. In a November interview, when asked by NBC whether there was going to be a database that tracks Muslims in the US, Trump said he "would certainly implement that." Outside of trade, Trump's first foreign policy priority will be defeating ISIS and other "radical Islamic terror groups," the document said. Referring to this security challenge as a clash of civilizations, Trump said in his remarks that the US will "unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the Earth." The document listed as a second priority rebuilding the military to ensure that "our military dominance must be unquestioned." US military spending in 2015 was roughly the same as the next seven-largest military budgets combined, including China, Russia and the UK. A third is embracing diplomacy. "We are always happy when old enemies become friends and when old friends become allies," the statement said, a possible reference to Russia. Trump has often said he wants to improve relations with Moscow, in part to fight terrorism. In his remarks, Trump said "we will reinforce old alliances and form new ones." Trump's commitment to existing US alliances isn't entirely certain, however. He has dismissed NATO as "obsolete," though it is a bedrock part of the US international security umbrella from Afghanistan to Europe. And he has suggested re-examining ties to Gulf countries and Asian nations, such as Japan and South Korea, which have traditionally worked closely with Washington. In nomination hearings, Trump's Cabinet members, including the secretary of defense pick James Mattis and Tillerson, took starkly different views, stressing the importance of and need for strong ties to NATO and support for Asian allies in China's shadow.

He arrived at the White House for the first time as President just before 5 p.m. ET following a day of tradition marking the power shift in the nation's capital. In a time-honored ceremony on the flag-draped West Front of the Capitol earlier in the afternoon, Trump placed his left hand on a family Bible and another that belonged to Abraham Lincoln and promised to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. As light rain began to fall on a crowd stretching toward the Washington Monument, Trump took the oath of office from Chief Justice John Roberts with the new first lady, Melania, by his side. Trump's inaugural address centered on the themes that animated his stunning outsider campaign, which shattered political conventions and gave voice to heartland voters who felt badly let down by professional politicians. Though he paid tribute to outgoing President Barack Obama, the President sketched a vision of America that came across as a repudiation of the last administration. He promised to restore the nation's strength and purpose and to rebuild it from within, vowing to "bring back" American jobs, borders, wealth and dreams. "We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, and in every foreign capital and in every hall of power," Trump said. "From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land, from this day forward, it's going to be only 'America first! America first!'" Trump talked of a nation of mothers and children trapped in poverty in the inner cities and "rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones," and warned crime and gangs had robbed the nation of much of its potential. "This American carnage stops right here and stops right now," Trump said, with Obama looking on. "A new national pride will stir our souls, lift our sights and heal our divisions," Trump said, emphasizing that whether people are black or white they still bleed the same red blood of patriots. And he told Americans listening to the address: "You will never be ignored again." Former Presidents George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter attended the ceremony. Hillary Clinton, whom Trump defeated in the November election, was in the audience in a show of support for national unity and the peaceful transfer of presidential authority. But, contrary to some expectations, Trump made no gesture of reconciliation toward Clinton or her supporters following the deeply divisive campaign in which he won the Electoral College but lost the popular vote. He later recognized her during a congressional lunch, when she received a standing ovation. "I was very honored, very, very honored when I heard that President Bill Clinton and Secretary Hillary Clinton was coming today, I think it is appropriate to say it," Trump said. "Honestly, there is nothing more I can say because I have a lot of respect for those two people." The swearing-in was one of many traditions that began Friday morning. Trump and his family attended a private worship service at St. John's Episcopal Church, known as the church of presidents. The Obamas greeted Trump and the new first lady at the North Portico of the White House before hosting them for tea. Earlier in the morning, Obama wrote a letter to Trump and left it on the Resolute desk in the Oval Office, as outgoing presidents typically do for their successors. As Obama left the Oval Office for the final time, he was asked whether he had any words for the American people. "Thank you," Obama responded. The customs and symbolism that are playing out -- from Trump's ride to the Capitol with Obama to the first couple's dance at an inaugural ball -- are familiar. But the circumstances of this inauguration -- the 58th in the nation's history -- could hardly be more unconventional. When the presidential primary season began nearly a year ago, few thought Trump could survive the battle for the Republican nomination -- much less beat Clinton to win the presidency. He was the oldest president sworn in for a first term and the first president with no previous diplomatic, political or military executive experience. In what is always a poignant moment, the former President Obama and his wife left Capitol Hill on a helicopter bound for Joint Base Andrews for a farewell ceremony before taking one last flight on the presidential jet. The Obamas are heading to Palm Springs, California, for a vacation. Trump attended a joint congressional inaugural luncheon in the Capitol before heading back to the White House for the inaugural parade. Halfway along Pennsylvania Avenue, Trump's vehicle stopped and the new first couple walked hand in hand past the cheering crowds. By the time the motorcade approached the new Trump hotel, the President was back in the hulking car. In the evening, Trump and the new first lady will attend two inaugural balls, part of the stripped-down inaugural festivities that aides say are meant to stress that the new president is eager to get to work. Trump's supporters, who sent him to Washington to rip up political norms and thwart the establishment, are thrilled as he assumes power. The crowds started streaming toward the National Mall as dawn broke, with many people wearing Trump's distinctive red "Make America Great Again" baseball caps. But millions of Americans are also anxious, owing to the abrasive tone of Trump's campaign and fears over the consequences of his strongman leadership style. Trump has vowed to tear up US trade deals that he says disadvantage US workers, confront a rising China and improve estranged relations with Russia, despite allegations that Moscow interfered in the election. He has set high expectations for his presidency by promising to return jobs to US shores and reviving the manufacturing industry. He has pledged to crush ISIS and introduce tough new vetting on immigrants from countries where there is terrorist activity, raising fears of discrimination against Muslims. Trump is promising to build a wall on the southern border, to crack down on undocumented migrants and to gut the financial and environmental regulations that are at the center of the Obama administration's legacy. New presidents typically use the inaugural address -- viewed by a huge crowd fanned out on the National Mall and millions of television viewers -- to issue a call for national unity and ease the wounds of divisive elections. They typically remind Americans of the values and the history that binds them and of the nation's historic mission. Trump, so far, has done little to reach out to his foes since November. "He is still talking as if he is the insurgent candidate rather than the President-elect," said Robert Rowland, an expert on presidential rhetoric at the University of Kansas. "Historically, presidents who are effective use inaugural addresses to heal the wounds of the campaign, to talk about what it means to be an American, to discuss shared values and lay out their political principles to come across as a strong not vain leader." ©On the streets, in small gatherings and in the halls of government, people around the globe weighed in on US President Donald Trump's inauguration Friday, anticipating how his policies may play out on the international stage. But it was Russia's officials who tweeted some of the most celebratory messages, with one senator calling the day "a defining moment in history." Here is some of the reaction from around the world, from opposition to support -- and even indifference: A Women's March in Brussels elicited criticism of Trump's Katrine Steinfeld, a Norwegian-Hungarian who works for gender equality in Brussels, said she fears that Trump's election will legitimize the ill treatment of women. "It's crazy that this man can lead a country and assault women," Steinfeld said. "His behavior creates legitimacy for attitudes that is not appropriate and that is a threat for women," she added. Rebecca, who did not give her last name, was critical of Trump, but expressed cautiously optimism. "I came because I don't want Trump to be the new normal," said Rebecca, a Spaniard residing in Brussels. "It's a threat for moral and human rights. I'm not against him. I'm against what he says." "We need to watch and see what he will do," she added. "I give him credit and I will wait and see, but I fear it would be bad." Cuba's state media paid little attention to Trump's inauguration, perhaps wary of his promises to take a harder line on the communist-run island, CNN's Patrick Oppmann reports. Granma, the official communist party newspaper, ran articles Friday on birth statistics, the end of the baseball season and a new, experimental strain of cigar tobacco, but made no mention of Trump's swearing-in. During the presidential campaign, Trump A wary China watched one of its toughest critics assume the presidency Friday, marking the start of what could be a more contentious bilateral relationship between the world's two largest economies. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Friday before Trump was sworn in. Chunying emphasized constructive bilateral relations between the two countries to "propel further development of China-US ties at a new staring point." "We would like to join hands with the new US administration to uphold the principles of non-confrontation, non-conflict, mutual respect and win-win cooperation," Chunying said. During his inauguration address, Trump took a populist tone, saying, "We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs." Though he didn't mention China by name, he has vowed to be tougher on the country by renegotiating trade agreements and has even proposed imposing tariffs on Chinese imports. State-run communist media did not shy away from criticizing Trump last year, calling the then-candidate a "clown" and "big-mouthed." But tabloid-style newspaper Global Times wrote in a Friday editorial, "A favorable Sino-US relationship represents great progress in human political civilization, and it is hoped that Trump will consolidate this trend." Trump received a warm congratulations from India's prime minister and minister for information and broadcasting. "Looking forward to working with President @realDonaldTrump to further deepen India-US ties & realise the full potential of our cooperation," Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted. "Congratulations president @realDonaldTrump! Looking forward to enhanced Indo US ties. The two are natural allies in fight against terrorism," Minister for Information Rajyavardhan Rathore tweeted. There was little love for Trump at the Grand Mosalla, a complex of religious halls and other facilities in Tehran, as people gathered for their usual fiery Friday prayers, "It makes no difference which president is in power," a young man wearing a scarf depicting Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei told CNN. "Whoever is in power will have that same outlook on Iran, which is a pity." The main topic on the minds of many of those in attendance was the future of the Trump has called the agreement a bad deal, and said he wants to renegotiate it. Iran's government has rejected that idea, and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has insisted that one man Even before Trump's inauguration, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent him a welcome tweet. "Congrats to my friend President Trump. Look fwd to working closely with you to make the alliance between Israel&USA stronger than ever." Netanyahu has made it exceedingly clear that he's ready to work with Trump, especially as the relationship with President Obama deteriorated rapidly in its final weeks, CNN's Oren Liebermann reports. Israeli leaders are already expecting Trump to follow through on one of his biggest campaign promises -- to Israel's ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, said shortly after Trump's inauguration: "We look forward to your visit to Jerusalem, the capital of Israel." Jerusalem's Mayor, Nir Barkat, even launched a campaign just before the inauguration, calling on Trump to move the embassy. Scores of people -- mostly American expatriates, but also a few Japanese citizens -- marched in Tokyo on Friday evening to highlight what they say needs to be fought for during Trump's presidency. The event was organized by the group Democrats Abroad of Japan. "I just want to make sure that Trump knows that we are here," event organizer Erica Summers said. "Women are not going anywhere. I want to make sure we have our reproductive rights. I want him to know we (women) are equal, and he cannot get rid of us." About 550 miles to the southwest, a few hours before the inauguration, a few dozen Japanese conservatives enjoyed a celebration of the new American president at a restaurant in the city of Fukuoka. Since the swearing-in would be happening too late for their gathering, diners watched Election Night footage on a big screen. "Trump is such an honest, outspoken person who has the same way of political thinking as us," event organizer Yoko Mada said. "What conservatives in Japan have been wanting is to bring this nation out of the so-called post-war regime, and one symbolic thing would be us owning our own military again, which Trump supports." Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Friday extended his "heartfelt congratulations" to Trump. In a letter, Abe reflected on their November "I look forward to working hands in hands with you to ensure peace and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region and to address various challenges the international community faces," Abe said. President Enrique Pexc3xb1a Nieto tweeted nearly two hours after Trump's address, congratulating the new leader and expressing a desire to strengthen the relationship between the countries. Former President Vicente Fox wasn't nearly as gracious. An outspoken critic of Trump's pledge to have Mexico pay for a border wall, the former head of state kept up his During Trump's address, Fox tweeted: "Speaking of allegiance, Trump? Speaking of greatness? America was already great and succesful, then you happened!" And: "Prosperity comes in compassion and friendship. We will thrive, we will be succesful. Let the US lock themselves up!" Earlier in the morning, Fox tweeted this: "Today we turn into an era of uncertainty. If Donald the Unready doesn't learn to behave, the rest of the world needs to come together." Mexican Sen. Armando Rios Piter had some choice words for Trump: "Happiness is a good thing to work on and Mexico and the United States should be working in that way -- not in the way that Donald Trump has been talking." Trump's address did little to calm tensions or improve his reputation among protesters in Mexico City. The roundabout marked by Mexico's Angel of Independence was surrounded by protesters calling Trump a fascist, racist and xenophobe. Carrying signs that said "Make America human again" and "Love trumps hate," protesters chanted "Get out Trump." Juan Carlos Guerrero wore a souvenir T-shirt from Barack Obama's first presidential inauguration and asked two things of Trump: respect and a change in tone on NAFTA, the free-trade agreement Trump has threatened to eliminate to keep US jobs from moving to Mexico. Marquis Staples traveled to Mexico City from Wisconsin to make sure Mexicans know there is opposition to Trump in the United States. Holding a sign that read "F*ck Trump," Staples said Mexicans appreciated his presence, giving him thumbs up, high fives and honking their horns at his sign. Palestinian leaders offered few -- if any -- statements after the inauguration, but their primary concern echoed the mood on the streets. Thursday, thousands of Palestinians demonstrated across the West Bank, protesting the potential move of the US Embassy to Jerusalem. Demonstrators held up pictures of Trump and waved Palestinian flags. Well before dawn in the United States, about 200 people marched Friday against Trump in the Philippines' capital, Manila, Reuters reported. Demonstrators burned a mock, paper US flag before lighting an actual one. Chants included: "US troops out now!" "Filipinos from Manila to Washington to New York are joining protest actions against what they believe to be ... a fascist and racist regime, and now the chief representative of US imperialism," Renato Reyes Jr., secretary-general of the Philippines' left-wing Some protesters carried signs labeled Bayan Muna, the leftist alliance's political party. People also held signs with messages such as "Donald Trump, pullout US troops in the PH!" and "Fight Trump. Resist fascism and imperialism." Late Friday, Russia's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a Facebook post: "In a world of many things can happen, except one: President Obama can't say anything anymore about Russia." This follows a series of tweets from Alexei Pushkov, an outspoken Russian senator and former chairman of the Parliamentary Foreign Relations Committee. Pushkov's tweets seems to pave the way for "improved" Russia-US relations. "xd0x90fter Mr.Trump inauguration his meeting with President Putin will be the most important event in world politics. A defining moment in history," he tweeted. Pushkov also said the United States would need Russia to solve the ISIS problem. "Trump said that the destruction of ISIL is a main priority," Pushkov tweeted. "To solve the problem, he won't need Warsaw, Kiev or [Lithuania's capital] Vilnius. He'll need Russia." Hours before the inauguration, acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn sent a letter of congratulations to Trump. Kyo-ahn highlighted the importance of the South Korea-U.S. alliance and urged close cooperation in countering North Korean nuclear threats. Meanwhile, the country's semi-official Yonhap news agency called Trump's speech "strongly negative" toward America's security commitments overseas despite a promise to "reinforce all the alliances." The new American president drew a message of congratulations from the UK's foreign minister around the time of the inauguration speech. "Congratulations to @realDonaldTrump @POTUS on his presidential inauguration day. Look forward to continuing strong UK - US bond," Boris Johnson tweeted. Earlier in the day, a UK-based protest group used signs and bridges across the country to convey a less celebratory message. The group unfurled an 80-foot banner reading "Bridges Not Walls" on the iconic Tower Bridge over London's River Thames on Friday morning -- one of more than 150 such strips that the group planned to display on bridges across the country. Similar banners or signs were displayed on some of London's other spans, including Waterloo Bridge and Blackfriars Bridge. The group, "On Trump's inauguration day we're taking action to show our support for groups under attack -- here in the UK, across Europe and in the USA -- and to reject the rise of a dangerous and divisive far right politics," a message from representative Nona Hurkmans says on the group's website. Meanwhile, drinks flowed as some Republican US expatriates and like-minded Brits cheered Trump at an inauguration "It gives me great confidence in our democracy," the group's chair, Malise Sundstrom, said. "I think in my lifetime I won't see a transition of power like this. A change like this. It's really exciting to see." Gloria Martin looked like a proud American, wearing a red, white and blue sash while speaking with a crisp, British accent. "I'm a Londoner and I love him," she said. "I think it's a movement now going across the whole of the Western world. We don't want to be represented anymore by politicians who do not listen to their voters." Pope Francis is praying for Trump, the pontiff "Upon your inauguration as the forty-fifth President of the United States of America, I offer you my cordial good wishes and the assurance of my prayers that Almighty God will grant you wisdom and strength in the exercise of your high office," Francis wrote, according to the Vatican. "At a time when our human family is beset by grave humanitarian crises demanding farsighted and united political responses, I pray that your decisions will be guided by the rich spiritual and ethical values that have shaped the history of the American people and your nation's commitment to the advancement of human dignity and freedom worldwide. "Under your leadership, may America's stature continue to be measured above all by its concern for the poor, the outcast and those in need who, like Lazarus, stand before our door. "With these sentiments, I ask the Lord to grant you and your family, and all the beloved American people, his blessings of peace, concord and every material and spiritual prosperity." "With these sentiments, I ask the Lord to grant you and your family, and all the beloved American people, his blessings of peace, concord and every material and spiritual prosperity." ©In his first speech to the nation as the President of the United States, Donald Trump vowed Friday that every decision he makes would be intended to "benefit American workers and American families." And moments after Trump took the oath of office outside of the US Capitol, the official White House website was updated to reflect the new administration and its priorities. As of midday, the website listed six key policy areas: energy, foreign policy, jobs, military, law enforcement and trade. Here are the policy promises that Trump made as the newly sworn-in President: Trump reiterated in his speech Friday a theme he highlighted repeatedly during the presidential campaign: "America First." "We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world -- but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first," Trump said. Another top campaign promise Trump made was to strengthen the country's borders and stop illegal immigration. On Friday, Trump said: "We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs. Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength." The White House website also notes that Trump -- as a part of supporting law enforcement -- backs "deporting illegal aliens with violent criminal records who have remained within our borders." That's a policy the Obama administration also pursued. The White House website promises "pro-growth tax reform" and the importance of "renegotiating existing trade deals." And in his address, Trump said: "We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams." Trump often complained on the campaign trail about the country's crumbling infrastructure (including his hometown LaGuardia Airport). On Friday, the President said he would address these issues head-on. "We will build new roads, and highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels and railways all across our wonderful nation," Trump said. Trump, who pledged during the campaign to "bomb the s--- out of ISIS," said Friday that he would "eradicate" the terrorist organization. "We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones -- and unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the Earth," Trump said. "Energy is an essential part of American life and a staple of the world economy," the White House website says. "The Trump administration is committed to energy policies that lower costs for hardworking Americans and maximize the use of American resources, freeing us from dependence on foreign oil." One of Trump's top legislative priorities as president was notably missing from his inaugural address: health care reform. Trump has vowed to "repeal and replace" the Affordable Care Act as quickly as possible, and Republican lawmakers have already started the process of rolling back parts of former President Barack Obama's landmark health care law. The new White House website also did not mention health care policy as of Friday afternoon.

Former first lady Barbara Bush also continues to improve, he added. The 92-year-old former President was The couple were comfortable and watching coverage of "President Bush will remain in the ICU (intensive care unit) for observation," McGrath said. "Mrs. Bush, meanwhile, continues to feel better and is focusing on spending time with her husband. "She is expected to remain in the hospital over the weekend as a precaution," he said. Their son Neil Bush and daughter-in-law Maria were visiting the couple Friday, McGrath said. Earlier in the week, he said no other family members were flying in because they felt everything was stable and moving in the right direction. Former President George W. Bush attended Trump's inauguration in Washington. Earlier this week, McGrath reported that George H.W. Bush initially was responding well to drugs. But Wednesday, the 41st President's condition changed and he was admitted to the intensive care unit, sedated and intubated. The former President was no longer sedated by Wednesday evening. Bush, who served a single term as President from 1989 to 1993, was already not expected to attend Trump's inauguration Friday due to health concerns. Bush sent a letter to Trump on January 10, apologizing for missing the ceremony and saying that he and Barbara "wish you the very best as you begin this incredible journey of leading our great country." "My doctor says if I sit outside in January, it likely will put me six feet under. Same for Barbara," Bush wrote, in a letter first reported by ABC News. "So I guess we're stuck in Texas." Trump responded on Twitter Wednesday, wishing the Bushes a speedy recovery and thanking them for their note. "Looking forward to a speedy recovery for George and Barbara Bush, both hospitalized. Thank you for your wonderful letter!" he tweeted. Bush revealed several years ago that he suffered from a form of Parkinson's disease that left him unable to walk. He uses a wheelchair or a scooter to get around and had two other health scares in 2014 and 2015. In December 2014, he was hospitalized after experiencing shortness of breath, and the following July fell at his home in Kennebunkport, Maine, breaking a vertebrae in his neck. The injury did not result in any neurological problems, his spokesman said at the time.

Nothing hits home that point more strongly than these letters outgoing presidents have left for the incoming occupants of the White House. ©It was not the Inauguration Day that Hillary Clinton imagined. When the skies finally opened up on Friday and rain began to fall over the US Capitol, Clinton's turn to stand before the thousands gathered on the Mall and take the oath of office as the 45th president never came. Instead, she remained seated with her husband, Bill Clinton, by her side. And she watched a man whom she believes is fundamentally unfit to hold the highest office of the land get sworn in as her next president. Donald Trump's inauguration on Friday and the ceremonial passing of the baton by Barack Obama crystalized before a watchful nation the deeply personal loss that Clinton had suffered in November. For the former Democratic presidential nominee, the decision to attend Friday's ceremony was not an easy one. Clinton anticipated that it would be painful for her to watch Trump become the next president, according to a former aide, but felt she had no choice but to attend given her role both as former first lady and Trump's challenger. It weighed on her, this aide added, that her presence symbolized the peaceful transition of power, regardless of her own emotions about the day. The Clintons arrived on Capitol Hill shortly before the swearing-in. At the same time, the presidential motorcade was making its way down Pennsylvania Ave. towards the Capitol. In one car sat two men who had each taken away Clinton's dreams of becoming president -- Obama and Trump. Clinton wore a white coat -- something she did often on the campaign trail to represent the color women wore during the suffrage movement. She and Bill Clinton were introduced to the inaugural stage by the announcer as "the 42nd president of the United States, William Jefferson Clinton, and the honorable Hillary Rodham Clinton." For Clinton's supporters, both were painful reminders of how close Clinton -- the first woman to clinch a major political party's nomination for president -- had come to becoming to the president of the United States. With the exception of when she exchanged pleasantries with other dignitaries on the stage, Clinton, for the most part, appeared stoic. Trump, with his former political opponent seated behind him, delivered an inaugural address reminiscent of his campaign speeches, vowing that the "forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer." "This Trump did not mention Clinton in the address. But during the luncheon honoring Trump and Vice President Mike Pence in the Capitol's Statuary Hall, Trump rose to deliver gracious remarks about Clinton. It was a striking contrast from even a few months ago, when Trump had threatened to jail her if he became president and repeatedly dredged up some of the most painful moments of the Clintons' turbulent marriage, including Bill Clinton's infidelities. "I was very honored, very, very honored, when I heard that President Bill Clinton and Secretary Hilary Clinton was coming today," Trump said, before asking both to stand, when they received a long round of applause. "Honestly," Trump added, "there's nothing more I can say because I have a lot of respect for those two people." For Clinton and her aides, losing the presidential election to Trump had been a difficult scenario to imagine for the better part of the general election. In the heat of a contentious and bitter campaign, the former secretary of state let her tone grow increasingly dark, as she repeatedly warned the American people that the values Trump espoused were un-American. "Imagine that on January 20, 2017, it is Donald Trump standing in front of our Capitol and taking the oath of office," Clinton told her supporters in Las Vegas, Nevada, just three days out from the election. "Imagine with me what it would be like to have Donald Trump sitting in the Oval Office come next January." More than two months after the election, a political scandal that had haunted Clinton's presidential run still lingered. GOP Rep. Jason Chaffetz, the chairman of the House Oversight Committee that investigated Clinton's use of a private email service during her time at the State Department, posted a photo of himself shaking hands with Clinton on the inaugural platform. His caption read: "So pleased she is not the President. I thanked her for her service and wished her luck. The investigation continues." Republican Sen. John Cornyn, who was seated at the same table as Clinton for the lunch, told CNN that she appeared to be in good spirits but lamented the vitriolic nature of politics. "She did talk about how she hoped our politics was more consensus-building and everybody can have their views but it doesn't have to be poisonous," Cornyn said. "She did talk about how she hoped our politics was more consensus-building and everybody can have their views but it doesn't have to be poisonous," Cornyn said. ©President Donald Trump and his wife, Melania, displayed the New York glamour of their family Friday night in a uniquely American tableau as they all swayed on stage before a backdrop of red, white and blue. Their first dance was to Frank Sinatra's 1969 hit "My Way." The Rockettes performed in top hats and hot pants. Melania Trump stunned the crowds in a sleek white, off-the-shoulder column dress with a swooping arc across her torso and (modestly) leg-baring slit. The somber inaugural festivities Friday afternoon marked the peaceful transfer of power. The inaugural balls Friday night were where the new President put his first stamp on Washington style. The former real estate mogul, known for his affinity for over-the-top gold fixtures, went for classic Americana with touch of retro glitz. The parade of acts that performed at the three balls were reminiscent of what an itinerary might look like on a first trip to the attractions of Broadway and Radio City Music Hall in New York City. Trump hinted ahead of time that his footwork wouldn't be fancy -- with a source telling CNN that he had no interest in practicing the first dance. And the focus of the night was on the fashion of the new first family. In the most-anticipated surprise of the evening, Melania Trump helped design her jaw-dropping white dress in a collaboration with Herve Pierre, the former creative director of Carolina Herrera. Pierre said in a statement to Women's Wear Daily that the first lady put her own distinct imprint on the dress. "She knows what she likes," Pierre told Women's Wear Daily. "Our conversations were, and are, very easy. She knows about fashion, as a former model. She is aware about constructions, so we have already the same vocabulary when it comes to designing a dress." President Trump's oldest daughter, Ivanka Trump, wore a white Oscar de la Renta pantsuit earlier in the day and chose another classic American designer for the evening, wearing a gold Carolina Herrera ball gown with jeweled sleeves and bodice and a bell-shaped skirt. The President's other daughter, Tiffany Trump, as well as the wives of Eric and Donald Jr. Trump -- Lara and Vanessa -- all wore varying metallic shades of silver, gold and pink with modified mermaid silhouettes. Eight years ago, the Obamas launched their celebrity-studded era with Beyonce singing "At Last" as Michelle Obama ushered in a new era of fresh-faced American designers in her white one-shouldered Jason Wu gown. Former President George W. Bush brought a decidedly Texas flair to DC by wearing his cowboy boots to the Black Tie and Boots Inaugural ball. The new President went for a pared-down celebration that was heavy on tributes to the military, patriotic themes and a reflection of his populism -- right down to the $50 tickets that were meant to make the balls accessible to average Americans who supported his campaign. The first couple dropped by all three official balls: two at the Washington Convention Center, as well as the invitation-only "Salute to Our Armed Services Ball" at the National Building Museum. Beyond the Rockettes, other featured acts included Lord of the Dance, the award-winning Irish dance troupe that burst on the scene in 1994, and jazz singer Erin Boheme, who kicked off the festivities by performing the 1956 hit "Mack the Knife." At the last ball, honoring American service members, Donald and Melania Trump danced to "I Will Always Love You," the song made famous by Whitney Houston in the 1992 movie "The Bodyguard" where she starred with Kevin Costner. They were joined onstage with service members as the music played. ©Inauguration Day serves as the most tradition-laden celebration that this young country has.

But let's be 100% honest: The last thing you need on moving day -- universally recognized as one of the In what was probably the most fascinating split screen in the history of television, Hillary Clinton shared the screen with, in the words of CNN's John King, "the two men who denied her the presidency." Don't worry, it got more awkward later. President Barack Obama showed then-President-elect Trump what is probably the most enviable part of being POTUS: no traffic. There is the speed at which glaciers move, and then there is the ceremonial walk pace. If the Trump children were forced to walk any slower through the Capitol, they would be walking backwards. On a day that is at least 40% about dramatic entrances and exits, Trump set the standard. Trump then said the Then it was time for the previous administration to make their dramatic exits. Former President Barack Obama left on a helicopter. But, in the Biden-iest of moves, former Vice President Joe Biden left for Delaware on the train. The long-time senator literally made that round-trip ride from Washington to Delaware President Trump During the official luncheon at the Capitol, Congress presented the new President and Vice President with gifts. One of the gifts was a picture from the swearing-in. Printing those photos was literally the quickest Congress has ever been at anything. President Trump even checked the photo to make sure it was real. It was. Fun fact: Day drinking is perfectly acceptable when you're grown adults who run the country. President Trump then acknowledged one of his very special guests: Hillary Clinton. I told you it got more awkward. Both parties handled the shout out with grace. Then the Inaugural Parade happened. It's not like a parade at Disney, but if limos are your thing, it was so much better! Vice President Mike Pence was there, too. He is already picking up the mantle of former Vice President Biden by delivering on the funny gestures. Here's to four years as GIFtastic as today.

The page lists information about Trump's life, including her modeling career and philanthropy. Earlier in the day, however, her QVC jewelry collection was mentioned. "In April 2010, Melania Trump launched her own jewelry collection, 'Melaniaxe2x84xa2 Timepieces & Jewelry,' on QVC," the biography said. QVC no longer sells jewelry under the Trump brand and the biography did not link to QVC. A spokeswoman for the company, Rebecca Blank, told CNN Friday that QVC does "not have an active relationship with the brand." The Trump spokesperson said the reference to Trump's "entrepreneurial success" was based on fact and not an endorsement and noted that it was not available for sale. It's not the first time a member of the Trump family has been criticized for promoting a Trump brand. The namesake brand of President Donald Trump's oldest daughter, Ivanka, Abigail Klem, president of the Ivanka Trump brand, released a statement following the bracelet email that said it was sent by a "well-intentioned marketing employee" following "customary protocol." The employee, Klem wrote, "like many of us, is still making adjustments post-election. We are proactively discussing new policies and procedures with all of our partners going forward." Ivanka Trump took steps to separate herself from her brand's social media accounts later that month, and fully stepped away from the business in January.

"It's been the honor of my life to serve you. You made me a better leader and a better man," he said. His post-White House website, Obama.org, features a request form for scheduling events and a page for fundraising. "As we look forward, I want our first steps to reflect what matters most to you. Share your thoughts with me at Obama.org," he tweeted. "I won't stop; I'll be right there with you as a citizen, inspired by your voices of truth and justice, good humor, and love," Obama also tweeted. The final tweet from the Obama administration's control of the account @WhiteHouse came shortly thereafter, and featured a photo of Obama hand-in-hand with Rep. John Lewis as well as other civil rights activists in Selma, Alabama, in 2015. "Yes we can. Yes we did. Thank you for being a part of the past eight years," the account tweeted. The tweets come as more than 50 Democratic lawmakers -- including Lewis -- are planning to boycott Donald Trump's inauguration out of concern for how he came to power following US intelligence pointing to Russia's involvement in meddling with the 2016 election. Trump tweeted after Lewis' announcement to boycott that the civil rights icon was "all talk." And other lawmakers expressed concern about Trump's rhetoric and proposed policies towards women, immigrants, Latinos and other groups that overwhelmingly supported Hillary Clinton in the campaign. "I'm still asking you to believe - not in my ability to bring about change, but in yours. I believe in change because I believe in you," Obama tweeted. Obama wrote an emotional public letter, published Thursday, thanking Americans and encouraging them to participate into "daily acts of citizenship." "Before I leave my note for our 45th president, I wanted to say one final thank you for the honor of serving as your 44th," he wrote. "Because all that I've learned in my time in office, I've learned from you. You made me a better president, and you made me a better man."

The Obamas boarded the plane in Washington early Friday afternoon after Donald Trump's inauguration.

They went home disappointed. ©Gliding toward Joint Base Andrews in his military helicopter Friday, Barack Obama watched a dramatically altered Washington recede from view, the work of his presidency now over and the future of his accomplishments uncertain. Waving at a crowd gathered to witness his political and ideological opposite sworn into office, Obama revealed no apprehension at handing the most powerful job in the world to Donald Trump. His head cocked, there were no outward signs of hard feelings as Donald Trump derided his tenure during his inaugural address. But the differences with his successor were plain. The White House's final tweet under Obama was a photo of Obama hand-in-hand with Democratic Rep. John Lewis, the civil rights leader who Trump lambasted this week, walking down the Alabama bridge where Lewis was beaten by police in 1965. And Obama previewed a return to public life when he was addressing members of his staff at Joint Base Andrews moments after Trump was sworn in. "This is just a little pit stop," he said. "This is not a period, this is a comma in the continuing story." Obama is more popular by far than his successor, but the accomplishments that defined his presidency are in doubt. Trump ran on a change agenda, vowed to end many of Obama's programs, and has a Republican Congress that's largely in step with his governing priorities. The two men share a long and personal animosity. Trump stoked the racist birther conspiracy that suggested Obama wasn't a legitimate president. Obama jabbed Trump at the White House Correspondents' Dinner 2011, enraging the real estate mogul. Unease about the future, however, was cast aside Friday, as Obama and Trump carried out the traditional rituals of transferring power. The handoff began in the morning when Obama and his wife greeted the incoming first couple on the steps of the North Portico. The mood was jocular; Obama told Trump he would get used to the camera snaps that will soon accompany many of his movements. It's only the second time the two have met, after their post-election huddle in the Oval Office. The moment was a symbol of Democracy's reins being handed off peacefully. Not handed off quite as gracefully: a blue box from the American jeweler Tiffany and Co., a gift from Melania Trump to her predecessor, Michelle Obama that was awkwardly given to an aide before the formal photo was snapped. Inside, the couples sat for tea and coffee in the White House Blue Room. The space is situated one floor below the private living quarters where the Obamas slept on Thursday night and where Trump will sleep Friday. The Obamas, who traveled to Capitol Hill in the same armored limousine with the Trumps, dutifully watched the swearing-in and speech. They stood on the East Front steps of the Capitol with their replacements, he chatting amiably and she stoic. They stepped for a final time into the military helicopter, known for this flight as Executive One without a sitting president aboard. The former president and his wife decamped for the West Coast, flying for a final time on the presidential aircraft to Palm Springs, California. They're expected to remain for a time in the desert oasis at the home of Michael Smith, who decorated their private living quarters and designed Obama's Oval Office. His aides said they didn't expect to see Obama at least until next month. Obama has spent the last two months bidding farewell, sitting for lengthy media interviews, delivering a prime-time address in Chicago, and using the White House's social media channels to tout his presidential record. His final acts in office hewed closely with the legacy he hopes to leave as president: On Thursday, Obama commuted the sentences of more than 300 non-violent drug offenders, continuing his clemency push. And he transferred four more detainees from the Guantanamo Bay naval prison, which he spent eight years trying unsuccessfully to close. In his post-presidency, Obama is expected to begin writing a book with the help of his White House speechwriter Cody Keenan. He's named a senior adviser and a chief of staff for his private office, and on Friday a website that allows users to inquire about speaking engagements went live. The Obamas will remain in Washington, living in the same neighborhood as Trump's daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, named as Trump's senior adviser. Like other ex-presidents, he'll work from an office, in this case inside the headquarters of the World Wildlife Foundation. But he's said he'll lay low, quietly processing the events of the past eight years and only speaking out against Trump's actions if they threaten "core values." Before he faced Trump on Friday, Obama made his final visit to the Oval Office, the cauldron of power where he plotted a health care overhaul, diplomatic agreements with Iran and Cuba, and a global climate accord. As he left for the final time, he slipped a single-page letter to Trump into the top drawer of the Resolute Desk -- crafted from timbers of a 19th century Arctic exploration ship -- that he hopes his successor will read carefully as he absorbs the magnitude of his new life. As he departed the Oval Office, Obama was upbeat and smiling. "Are you feeling nostalgic?" a reporter asked from the Rose Garden. "Of course," said the President. "Any last words for the American people?" asked another. "Thank you." "Thank you." ©President Obama departed the Oval Office for the final time Friday, slipping a letter for Donald Trump into the top drawer of his desk and striding toward the Residence.

The Pope extended the new President good wishes and hoped that his decisions would be guided by the values that have helped shape the country. ©White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus issued a memorandum Friday night to all executive departments and agencies to freeze new or pending regulations -- giving the new administration time to review them. The action is a fairly standard move for a new administration taking over from the other party. It effectively halts any lingering policies from the Obama administration before they can be finalized. The move also gives President Donald Trump the ability to declare an immediate impact on the regulations that Republicans have long slammed as burdensome on businesses - a major promise of his administration. Still, to roll back any number of the regulations that were finalized in the eight years that Barack Obama was president, Trump will need an act of Congress or will need his agencies to begin the regulatory process from scratch. Federal regulations go through a multi-step process in order to take full effect. The President cannot halt any regulations that have gone into effect already, but lays out steps for any that are not fully in action. For any regulations that have yet to be sent for publishing in the Federal Register, the memo asks the agency to not send any regulation to the Federal Register until reviewed by someone selected by the President. For those that have been sent but not published, the White House ordered the regulations withdrawn. There are regulations have been published but have not reached their effective date. The memo instructs those regulations to be delayed for 60 days for review -- with a potential that a new notice for reopening the regulation could occur. The memo makes an exception for "critical health, safety, financial, or national security matters," and asks agencies to identify any regulations that can't be delayed for other reasons.

James Mattis to run the Department of Defense Retired Marine Gen. John Kelly similarly sailed through for Homeland Security, though he had more detractors. He was confirmed 88-11. The Senate will not consider Kansas Rep. Mike Pompeo for CIA director until Monday, after at least three Democrats objected to his quick confirmation over concerns including surveillance. Instead, they voted on opening debate on his nomination, a procedural step. "I am pleased by the confirmation votes of Generals Mattis and Kelly. These uniquely qualified leaders will immediately begin the important work of rebuilding our military, defending our nation and securing our borders. I am proud to have these two American heroes join my administration," Trump said in a White House statement, his first since becoming President. "I call on members of the Senate to fulfill their constitutional obligation and swiftly confirm the remainder of my highly qualified cabinet nominees, so that we can get to work on behalf of the American people without further delay." Later Friday night, Trump signed papers confirming Mattis and Kelly's appointments, and both were sworn in by Vice President Mike Pence. In a statement to the Department of Defense Friday night, Mattis pointedly praised the intelligence community, saying that along with the Pentagon, they are "the sentinels and guardians of our nation." He also vowed to "work with the State Department to strengthen our alliances." The comments were notable in their contrast to public positions taken by Trump, most notably his skepticism of the intelligence community's increasing belief that Russia meddled in the 2016 election to aid him and hurt Hillary Clinton's campaign. The two Inauguration Day confirmations were fewer than the seven targeted by the Trump transition team. They had hoped to meet the number that President Barack Obama had on his Inauguration Day, but Senate Democrats have objected to many of Trump's nominees. Though Republicans have a Senate majority and are likely to confirm most if not all of Trump's Cabinet, Democrats can slow down the process by not agreeing to expedite Senate procedure. The two national security nominees were considered the least controversial of the picks. In order to be confirmed quickly by voice vote, the Senate must be unanimous. Any single senator may object to dispensing with procedural steps, which was why any of the three Democrats could delay Pompeo's nomination. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has been negotiating with Majority Leader Mitch McConnell over nominees. Over the weekend Senate committees announced some movement on confirmation hearings. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to meet Monday to vote on Rex Tillerson's nomination for secretary of state. The Judiciary Committee will meet to consider attorney general nominee Sessions on Tuesday, but a vote is expected to be delayed for a week. Also on Tuesday Trump's choice to head the Health and Human Services Department, Rep. Tom Price, will have a hearing before the Senate Finance Committee. It's his second committee hearing but the Finance panel will be the one to vote on his nomination. That same day Rep. Mick Mulvaney, Trump's pick for OMB director, will have a hearing before the Senate Budget, Homeland Security and Government Affairs committees. And Linda McMahon, nominated to head the Small Business Administration, will have a hearing before Senate Small Business Committee. Tuesday will additionally include a Senate Commerce Committee vote on labor secretary nominee Elaine Chao and Wilbur Ross to head the Commerce Department. Democrats have accused the Republicans of trying to ram through Trump's nominees, complaining that multiple hearings were held concurrently, that required ethics paperwork wasn't delivered in enough time before confirmation hearings and that some of the nominees were too extreme. McConnell opened debate on the Senate floor Friday by lamenting the situation, especially that Democrats didn't allow Pompeo's confirmation immediately. "We need to confirm a new director today," McConnell said. "We need to confirm the rest of the Cabinet as quickly as we can." Schumer has said that his caucus has the right to express objections to nominees. After McConnell spoke on the floor, Sen. Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Senate Democrat, spoke about delays in ethics paperwork and Obama nominees that Senate Republicans held up throughout his tenure. Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, an outspoken critic of surveillance, Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy and Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal were the three Democrats who put out a statement Friday objecting to Pompeo's confirmation Friday. "No CIA director in history has ever been confirmed on Inauguration Day," their offices said in a joint statement. "The importance of the position of CIA director, especially in these dangerous times, demands that the nomination be thoroughly vetted, questioned and debated." Trump signed a bill clearing the way for Mattis to be confirmed as his first action as President earlier Friday. Congress passed the waiver -- making an exception to a law requiring defense secretaries be out of the military at least seven years before serving -- earlier this month.

A quickly evolving, ever more interconnected world. A rapidly changed economy that benefits too few while leaving too many behind. A fractured media. A politics frequently consumed by rancor. We face threats, foreign and domestic. In such times, faith in our government, our institutions and even our country can erode. Despite these challenges, I stand here today confident in this great country for one reason: you, the American people. "We Americans have always been a forward-looking, problem-solving, optimistic, patriotic and decent people. Whatever our race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, whether we are immigrant or native-born, whether we live with disabilities or do not, in wealth or in poverty, we are all exceptional in our commonly held yet fierce devotion to our country, and in our willingness to sacrifice our time, energy and even our lives to making it a more perfect union. "Today we celebrate one of democracy's core attributes: the peaceful transfer of power. And every day we stand up for core democratic principles enshrined in the Constitution: the rule of law; equal protection for all under law; the freedom of speech, press, religion -- the things that make America America. And we can gain strength from reading our history and listening to the voices of average Americans. They always save us in times of strife. "One such American was Maj. Sullivan Ballou. On July 14, 1861, when the North and South were lining up for their first battle, a time when our country was bitterly divided and faith in the future of our country was at a nadir, Maj.

Allow me to read some of his words, which echo through the ages. "'My very dear Sarah,' he wrote, 'The indications are very strong that we shall move in a few days, perhaps tomorrow. If it is necessary that I should fall on the battlefield for my country, I am ready. I have no misgivings about or lack of confidence in the cause in which I am engaged, and my courage does not halt or falter. I know how strongly American civilization now leans upon the triumph of the government and how great a debt we owe to those who went before us through the blood and suffering of the Revolution, and I am willing, perfectly willing, to lay down all my joys in this life to help maintain this government and to pay that debt. "'Sarah, my love for you is deathless. It seems to bind me to you with a mighty cables that nothing but omnipotence can break; and yet my love of country comes over me like a strong wind and bears me irresistibly on with all these chains to the battlefield.' "Sullivan Ballou gave his life on the battlefield a week later at the First Battle of Bull Run. It is because Sullivan Ballou and countless others believed in something bigger than themselves and were willing to sacrifice for it that we stand today in the full blessings of liberty in the greatest country on earth. And that spirit lives on in each of us, Americans whose families have been here for generations and those who have just arrived. And I know our best days are yet to come. "I urge all Americans to "Now, please stand while the Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, Clarence Thomas, administers the oath of office to the Vice President of the United States."

Trump signed his first executive orders at the Resolute Desk before new gold curtains with a blue trim, a new sunburst-patterned carpet and new brocade couches. The Churchill bust sat on a sidetable, while the figure of Martin Luther King Jr. that former President Barack Obama had installed when he came into the White House remains next to the fireplace. Each president tends to decorate their own Oval Office. But the King-for-Churchill swap angered some Anglophiles -- and conservative pundits -- who felt that Churchill's ouster was an affront to the British. "There are only so many tables where you can put busts -- otherwise it starts looking a little cluttered," Obama said at a press conference in London Obama moved the Churchill bust to outside the Treaty Room in his private residence, enraging White House adviser Dan Pfeiffer pushed back against the outrage in a White House blog post in 2012. "The White House has had a bust of Winston Churchill since the 1960s. At the start of the Bush administration, Prime Minister (Tony) Blair lent President Bush a bust that matched the one in the White House, which was being worked on at the time and was later returned to the residence. The version lent by Prime Minister Blair was displayed by President (George W.) Bush until the end of his presidency. On January 20, 2009 -- Inauguration Day -- all of the art lent specifically for President Bush's Oval Office was removed by the curator's office, as is common practice at the end of every presidency. The original Churchill bust remained on display in the residence. "The idea put forward by Charles Krauthammer and others that President Obama returned the Churchill bust or refused to display the bust because of antipathy towards the British is completely false and an urban legend that continues to circulate to this day."

Indeed, the call came hours after President Donald Trump was sworn in. Government lawyers asked the court for a delay "because of the federal government's change in administration." "The United States requires additional time to brief the new leadership of the department on this case and the issues to be addressed at that hearing before making any representations to the court. This motion is made in good faith and not for the purposes of delay," the government lawyers wrote. CNN contributor Steve Vladeck points out that on the surface, the filing suggests something obvious: the new administration is working to get its legs under it. "There's nothing unorthodox about the Justice Department buying itself a little bit of time to figure out whether it wants to stake out a new position," he said. "But the fear for the groups is what that position might be," Vladeck added. The case is in a complex posture. Last summer an appeals court ruled against the law. One part of the case is before a district court, the other is currently pending before the Supreme Court. "Whether this signals a shift in position or truly is a request for time to review remains to be seen," said Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under the Law.

We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort to rebuild our country and to restore its promise for all of our people. Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for years to come. We will face challenges. We will confront hardships. But we will get the job done. Every four years, we gather on these steps to carry out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power, and we are grateful to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid throughout this transition. They have been magnificent. Today's ceremony, however, has very special meaning. Because today we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another, or from one party to another -- but we are transferring power from Washington, D.C. and giving it back to you, the American People. For too long, a small group in our nation's Capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost. Washington flourished -- but the people did not share in its wealth. Politicians prospered -- but the jobs left, and the factories closed. The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country. Their victories have not been your victories; their triumphs have not been your triumphs; and while they celebrated in our nation's capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land. That all changes -- starting right here, and right now, because this moment is your moment: it belongs to you. It belongs to everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across America. This is your day. This is your celebration. And this, the United States of America, is your country. What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but whether our government is controlled by the people. January 20th 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again. The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. Everyone is listening to you now. You came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before. At the center of this movement is a crucial conviction: that a nation exists to serve its citizens. Americans want great schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for themselves. These are the just and reasonable demands of a righteous public. But for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists: Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of knowledge; and the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential. This American carnage stops right here and stops right now. We are one nation -- and their pain is our pain. Their dreams are our dreams; and their success will be our success. We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny. The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all Americans. For many decades, we've enriched foreign industry at the expense of American industry; subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military; we've defended other nation's borders while refusing to defend our own; and spent trillions of dollars overseas while America's infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and decay. We've made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has disappeared over the horizon. One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions upon millions of American workers left behind. The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across the entire world. But that is the past. And now we are looking only to the future. We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power. From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this moment on, it's going to be America First. Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers and American families. We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs. Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength. I will fight for you with every breath in my body -- and I will never, ever let you down. America will start winning again, winning like never before. We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams. We will build new roads, and highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and railways all across our wonderful nation. We will get our people off of welfare and back to work -- rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor. We will follow two simple rules: Buy American and hire American. We will seek friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world -- but we do so with the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first. We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to follow. We will reinforce old alliances and form new ones -- and unite the civilized world against radical Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from the face of the Earth. At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other. When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice. The Bible tells us, "How good and pleasant it is when God's people live together in unity." We must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always pursue solidarity. When America is united, America is totally unstoppable. There should be no fear -- we are protected, and we will always be protected. We will be protected by the great men and women of our military and law enforcement and, most importantly, we are protected by God. Finally, we must think big and dream even bigger. In America, we understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving. We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action -- constantly complaining but never doing anything about it. The time for empty talk is over. Now arrives the hour of action. Do not let anyone tell you it cannot be done. No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America. We will not fail. Our country will thrive and prosper again. We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the Earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow. A new national pride will stir our souls, lift our sights, and heal our divisions. It is time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget: that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots, we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great American Flag. And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of life by the same almighty Creator. So to all Americans, in every city near and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, and from ocean to ocean, hear these words: You will never be ignored again. Your voice, your hopes, and your dreams will define our American destiny. And your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way. Together, We will make America strong again. We will make wealthy again. We will make America proud again. We will make America safe again. And yes, together, we will make America great again. Thank you. God bless you. And God bless America. And yes, together, we will make America great again. Thank you. God bless you. And God bless America. ©Perhaps Dan Quayle said it best: "He was the same old Donald Trump." The former Republican vice president, inside the Capitol following "He's going to make America great again," Quayle said. "He's going to bring people together. And that's the only way to make America great again is to work together." But just as they did during the blistering 2016 campaign, different ears heard different things during Trump's inaugural speech to the nation. That was particularly true among many of those who sat behind him as he took the oath of office, those who served as a backdrop as he assumed the ultimate mantle of power -- members of Congress with whom President Trump now has to work. Inaugurations are generally intended to be feel-good events that bring the country -- and the capital -- together, if only for a brief moment in time. A strong inaugural address includes memorable lines that outlive a presidency and a president, soaring rhetoric that even the most partisan politicians can admire. Think Franklin D. Roosevelt: "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself." Think John F. Kennedy: "Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country." High standards, to be sure. But even lesser orators than FDR and JFK have risen to the moment in their own way, painting a vision that inspires Republicans and Democrats to work together for the greater good. Trump had some memorable lines, most notably: "This American carnage stops right here and stops right now." But his sometimes dark rhetoric was often more cajoling than inspiring. Trump's speech echoed many of the themes of his campaign. It emphasized populism, putting "America first" and returning the country to some previous greatness. Music to the ears of his supporters. But a bit scratchy to other listeners. "It was a continuation of what he campaigned on," Sen. John McCain, the Arizona Republican who was at times critical of that campaign, repeated three times in quick succession. "I didn't particularly like or dislike any part of it. I thought it was a continuation of his campaign for president." As they filed into the Capitol following the inauguration, a number of Democrats signaled their dismay by simply walking away as a reporter asked for their reactions. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a frequent Trump critic, didn't have a word to say as she strode briskly through the ornate Rotunda. Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota let a staffer intervene on his behalf with a simple "no comment." Sen. Amy Klobuchar, also a Minnesota Democrat, said she wanted to read the speech before speaking about it. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who sought the Democratic nomination, said he wanted to "hold off on a statement at this point." Both senators then walked away. Other Democrats were more expansive -- and critical. "I think America's the leading world power and that was not a speech that was uplifting or committed America to continued leadership in the world," said Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia. Given the divisiveness of the campaign and the fact that Trump lost the popular vote to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, some Democrats expected him to offer something of an olive branch to voters -- and maybe even to politicians -- who might not have supported him. "I thought it was a missed opportunity," said Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon. "This is what I thought was going to happen: The president would say, 'I want to talk to all Americans who didn't vote for me. And all of you who didn't vote for me, I want to make sure we're all together in terms of working for solutions.' And, in that sense, even a handful of sentences like that I think could have made a big difference." "I was hoping for more of a unity speech," added Sen. Robert P. Casey Jr., of Pennsylvania. "An inaugural address is important, but what happens is obviously a lot more important. So we'll wait to see how he approaches his new responsibilities." Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri was incensed that Trump seemed to impugn the integrity of elected officials who preceded him in public service. "For too long, a small group in our nation's capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne the cost," Trump declared. "Washington flourished -- but the people did not share in its wealth. Politicians prospered -- but the jobs left, and the factories closed. The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country." "I just didn't realize that we were that terrible," McCaskill said. "I think he was so anxious to try to convince everyone that America is terrible now so that he can make it better that it felt awkward to me." "It's always such a day of pride for our country," she said of the quadrennial presidential inauguration. "And for his laundry list of our shortcomings to take such a prominent part of his speech was weird to me." Republicans defended their new standard bearer, saying he laid out the challenges facing the nation and pledged to overcome them. "I thought it was a good positive upbeat and hopeful speech," said Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee. Sen. Tim Scott, a Republican from South Carolina, had a different reason to like Trump's speech. "Seventeen minutes. It was amazing," he said. "I liked it because it was short. What we say is less important than what we do. So let's get on about doing the work of the people's business." As for the divergent reactions among his Senate colleagues, Scott offered this explanation: "We all have learned to decipher what he said so that we know what he meant. I think he meant for us to blame less and work more." "We all have learned to decipher what he said so that we know what he meant. I think he meant for us to blame less and work more." ©President Donald Trump promised a new era guided by one principle -- "only America first" -- moments after being sworn in as the nation's 45th commander-in-chief. But Friday's transfer of power from President Barack Obama's Democratic administration to Trump's nationalist Republican presidency featured many more symbolic moments from the former and new presidents and their families. Here are memorable moments from Inauguration Day: At noon Friday, Trump placed his left hand on two Bibles -- one used by Abraham Lincoln in 1861 and one a gift from his mother when Trump graduated Sunday School in 1955 -- and pledged to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. With that, the nation had its 45th President. And then the rain came. Trump stepped to the podium in front of a massive crowd of supporters -- though smaller than the throngs that attended President Barack Obama's inauguration in 2009 -- to deliver his inaugural address as raindrops splattered onto his shoulders. Rev. Franklin Graham said after Trump's speech that "in the Bible, rain is a sign of God's blessing." Trump stepped to the podium and delivered 16 minutes and 30 seconds of pure economic nationalism -- a revival of his campaign rhetoric and a rejection of much of Washington's hopes he might change once in office. "This American carnage stops right here and stops right now," Trump said with Obama looking on. "We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in every city, and in every foreign capital and in every hall of power," Trump said. "From this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this day forward, it's going to be only, 'America first! America first!'" "Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers and American families," Trump said. The philosophies Trump espoused weren't just a rejection of the former presidents -- particularly Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama -- sharing the stage with Trump. They threaten the conservative principles that are the bedrock of the Republican Party, too. An hour later, Trump moved to the Capitol for a lunch with Congress -- the very same political class had just so sternly denounced. The last time a new American president was inaugurated, Twitter wasn't the media powerhouse it is now. So Trump's inauguration marked the first time the official @POTUS account had to be handed off. At noon, Obama's tweets were all migrated to a new, archived account -- @POTUS44 -- and Trump took over the @POTUS account, which was suddenly empty. For a few minutes, a president known for communicating directly with his supporters via Twitter had control of a massive account displaying an odd message for the prolific tweeter Trump: "@POTUS hasn't tweeted yet." It was a split-screen for the ages: At the same moment Hillary and Bill Clinton descended the steps of the Capitol building, making their way to their seats in the audience, Obama and Trump left the White House to ride to inauguration together. The two men who had denied former Secretary of State Clinton the presidency would arrive in the same car. Clinton wore white -- a color with symbolism in the women's suffrage movement and her preference for major events, including her final debate with Trump and her speech accepting the Democratic nomination in Philadelphia. Before Trump's inauguration, Clinton's official account posted a tweet about her presence: "I'm here today to honor our democracy & its enduring values. I will never stop believing in our country & its future." She was composed throughout the ceremony, but Friday was the day she had warned supporters about. "Imagine that on January 20, 2017, it is Donald Trump standing in front of our Capitol and taking the oath of office," Clinton had said in a dire warning to supporters in Las Vegas, just three days from the election. "Imagine with me what it would be like to have Donald Trump sitting in the Oval Office come next January." While Trump made no mention of Hillary Clinton in his inaugural address he did single her out during the Capitol luncheon afterward, saying he was honored the Clintons were in attendance. "I'd like you to stand up," Trump said to Hillary Clinton. The entire room stood, turned to the Clintons and applauded, as Trump gave the rival he once promised to jail a finger-point and a thumbs-up. "And honestly, there's nothing more I can say, because I have a lot of respect for those two people," Trump said of the Clintons. Trump kept his remarks short, thanking congressional leaders for a photograph of his inauguration that was presented and nodding toward bipartisan cooperation. "We're all dealing together, we all want the same thing, we're all good people," Trump said. "Whether you're a Republican or Democrat, it doesn't make any difference." Barack and Michelle Obama were waiting at the White House steps to greet Donald and Melania Trump Friday morning after the Trumps attended church across from Lafayette Square. The moment was of symbolic importance, showing the willful and peaceful transfer of power. But it also showed just how awkward it can be to greet new acquaintances with the entire world watching. As Melania Trump went extended her hand for a shake, Michelle Obama leaned in, saying, "I'm a hugger" -- prompting Barack Obama to joke about the "protocol" for such occasions. The Trumps also brought a large, flat gift box from Tiffany and Co. -- which the outgoing President had to stash in the White House before the four could pose for a round of photos on the White House steps. The Obamas and Trumps were together again after Trump's inaugural address, as the Obamas prepared to depart via helicopter for Joint Base Andrews for a family vacation in Palm Springs, California. Walking down the back steps of the Capitol, Trump leaned into Obama and uttered something -- far enough away that microphones didn't pick it up -- that caused Obama to laugh. The former and new presidents talked and joked as the Pences and Bidens said their goodbyes. But the look on Michelle Obama's face was much different -- and seemed to reflect sadness. It's impossible to know what was in her mind. But it was, after all, Michelle Obama who delivered the strongest rebukes of Trump on the campaign trail for Clinton. And Trump's inaugural address had been a complete repudiation of Obama's presidency and political vision. As the Star-Spangled Banner played at Joint Base Andrews, Barack and Michelle Obama stood, singing, with tears in their eyes -- their last public moment on the last day of the Obama presidency. Trump sat down at Capitol Hill to take his first official actions as President: Signing a waiver allowing former Gen. James Mattis to become secretary of defense; a proclamation of a national day of patriotism; and nominations for his Cabinet. Huddled around him were his family and the top-ranking members of Congress -- and Trump immediately began schmoozing, handing out the pens he used to sign the nominations. "I got Price," said House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi, referring to Trump's nominee for Health and Human Services secretary. "You want Elaine's?" Trump asked Pelosi. That is Elaine Chao, Trump's transportation secretary pick, who is also the wife of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell -- who was standing nearby. "Here's one I think Nancy would like ... Scott Pruitt," Trump joked. Pruitt, Trump's EPA pick, is opposed by liberals. As the lawmakers laughed, Trump's family was less impressed. Son Barron, 10, stood over Trump's shoulder, playing peek-a-boo with older half-sister Ivanka Trump's baby. As the inaugural parade wound its way toward the White House, Trump, wife Melania and son Barron all exited the presidential limousine and walked, waving to the adoring crowds. Trump didn't actually walk past the Trump International Hotel -- his business's new location along the parade route. He got back into the limousine about half a block before reaching it. Later, Trump got back out of the limo in front of the Treasury Department to wave to crowds again. Just blocks from Trump's inaugural parade, protesters were clashing with police. A limo was on fire. Windows to a Starbucks and several other businesses had been smashed. Police were using pepper spray to control protesters who were destroying property. Two police officers suffered minor injuries in clashes with the protesters, and 95 had been arrested by mid-afternoon.

DONALD J. TRUMP THE WHITE HOUSE, January 20, 2017. # # # # # # ©Within hours of taking the oath of office, President Donald Trump on Friday night signed an executive order aimed at trying to fulfill one of his most impassioned campaign promises: Rolling back Obamacare. The multi-part executive order stated that the administration's official policy is "to seek the prompt repeal" of the Affordable Care Act -- but at the same time emphasized that it must continue to uphold the law. With his signature, Trump sent a powerful signal on Day One of his presidency: His top priority in the Oval Office will be dismantling the health care law that covers some 20 million Americans. The order does not change the law, but could have a significant impact nonetheless. It directs the secretary of health and human services, as well as other agencies, to interpret regulations as loosely as allowed to minimize the financial burden on individuals, insurers, health care providers and others. It stressed that agencies can "waive, defer, grant exemptions from or delay implementation of any provision or requirement" of Obamacare that imposes a burden "to the maximum extent permitted by law." One possible example is the individual mandate, which requires most Americans to be insured or pay a penalty unless they can prove a financial hardship. The Trump administration could try to loosen the criteria for qualifying for a hardship exemption. That way, fewer people would have to pay the penalty, which would be in line with the executive order and the call to provide relief to Americans suffering from the Obamacare's high costs. "This will set the gears of the bureaucracy moving in a very different direction," said Larry Levitt, senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. "Many of the changes envisioned in this order will take time to implement, but it signals a clear direction." In keeping with longstanding Republican beliefs, the order also looks to give states more flexibility and control over their health care markets and to allow insurers to offer policies across state lines. All of these actions will start to shift the nation's health care rules toward Republican ideas. And it will allow the Trump administration to chip away at the law going forward. However, little can be done until a health secretary -- and other key HHS officials -- are in place to work on changing those guidance and regulations. Trump's choice to lead HHS, Tom Price, faces the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday. An HHS spokesman said the agency will not release a statement on Friday. Much of Obamacare has already been set in regulation, which a president does not have the power to nullify and which can take months or even a year or two to change. Also, Trump and other Republican leaders have repeatedly said they want a "smooth transition" to a GOP plan so that millions of Americans will not suddenly lose coverage. "He has been told that he needs to comply with the law," said Timothy Jost, an emeritus professor at Washington and Lee University School of Law, "but is directing the agencies to begin taking steps towards reducing regulatory requirements and giving more discretion to the states. It's going to take time." Meanwhile, congressional Republicans are working to actually repeal major sections of the law -- including the individual mandate, subsidies and penalties -- but they remain divided over when and how to replace Obamacare. Conscious that millions of Americans are worried about losing their coverage, lawmakers have repeatedly said that their plan will give people more access to more affordable plans. Trump has also said he is nearly done working on a replacement proposal. Republican leaders in Congress, however, have said they have not been consulted. White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus also sent out a memo to all government agencies and departments calling for a regulatory freeze. Republicans have been railing against the health care law for years, using "repeal and replace Obamacare" as a political rallying cry to gin up support within the GOP base. During the presidential campaign, Trump promised his supporters that as president, he would do away with the law and that his alternative would be "something terrific." But Republican lawmakers are quickly learning how difficult it will be to overhaul the law. Initially, GOP leaders signaled that they would move forward with a vote to repeal major portions of Obamacare but delay the repeal from going into effect for a few years to give the party time to craft a replacement plan. But that "repeal and delay" strategy drew almost immediate pushback. Rank-and-file Republicans grew nervous that the uncertainty created by the lack of a replacement would spark chaos in the insurance market -- and leave the party holding the blame for millions of Americans who might confront either disrupted or halt in coverage. Trump has been adamant that "repeal and replace" must happen more or less simultaneously -- a stance that GOP leaders on the Hill have since adopted.

The strike -- which the Pentagon confirmed Friday afternoon in a statement -- hit a training camp west of Aleppo, near the Turkish border. A US B-52 bomber, along with armed drones, dropped 14 munitions on the camp, the official said. The site of the camp was well known to US intelligence. "The Shaykh Sulayman Training Camp was operational since at least 2013," Pentagon spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis said in the statement. "The removal of this training camp disrupts training operations and discourages hardline Islamist and Syrian opposition groups from joining or cooperating with al-Qaida on the battlefield." Davis noted that US strikes have killed 150 al Qaeda fighters since the start of the year. "These strikes, conducted in quick succession, degrade al Qaeda's capabilities, weaken their resolve, and cause confusion in their ranks," he said. The defense official said militants there at the time of the strike were part of the so-called "core al Qaeda" dating back to operatives who rose to power in the organization in Pakistan. Core members moved into this area last year. The strike, which occurred in the early evening hours of Thursday, come just hours after another major US airstrike against ISIS in Libya that killed more than 80 militants.

Spencer was answering questions on whether he was a neo-Nazi. He said he was not, and was then asked what the "Pepe the Frog" pin he was wearing signified. "Pepe the Frog" is an internet meme so often used by racists and anti-Semites it was As Spencer was speaking, a masked individual ran up, socked him in the face and fled. Spencer left, later tweeting there was, "no serious damage." "It was absolutely terrible," Spencer told CNN's Sara Ganim by phone hours after the assault. "I've certain never had this happen before -- a sucker punch in broad daylight." D.C. police said there is no open investigation into the assault as Spencer has not filed a police report. Spencer says he called 911 at the scene and plans to file a police report. "I kind of like getting into vigorous back and forth with people who disagree with me," said Spencer. "But punching like that just crosses a line -- totally unacceptable." He went onto say he feared future targeting, "Certainly, some people think I'm not a human being and I can just be attacked at will." In November, the racism and anti-Semitism of the alt-right movement were on display in Washington when its members gathered to celebrate Trump's victory. Atlantic magazine, which is recording footage of Spencer for a documentary, published a video of the same event showing audience members apparently giving the Nazi salute. "Hail Trump! Hail our people! Hail victory!" Spencer declared. His remarks then were filled with racist imagery -- including references to "the black political machines" and Latino housekeepers -- as he bashed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's minority supporters.

Cory Booker said Saturday he is not planning to run for president in 2020, telling CNN's Brooke Baldwin he wants to instead focus on running an effective opposition to the Trump administration. "Too many things can happen that can hurt people in our nation and around the globe if this President isn't checked," Booker told Baldwin, speaking at the Women's March in Washington. "Right now, I don't care about 2020. I don't care about 2018." "I am not open to being president," he added. "I don't even want to have the discussion right now." Earlier in the interview, Booker described the Trump presidency as a "bad thing" that must be resisted. "The reality is Donald Trump is President and bad things happen," the junior senator from New Jersey told Baldwin. "I think this is a bad thing. But, they don't define you. What defines you is how you choose to respond to that." Booker went on to compare Trump with his predecessors, former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, whom Booker said brought "a dignity to the office and magnanimity." The former mayor of Newark, New Jersey, also blamed Hillary Clinton's loss in the 2016 election on low voter turnout among his fellow Democrats. "We did not show up in the election," he said, speaking on "Newsroom." "The low voter turnout is astonishing and now, unfortunately, this is a reaction to something bad. But that's OK.

After Trump's swearing in, the newly minted president gave a short speech that was light on policy specifics but hit hard on many of his campaign themes, including protectionism, trade-skepticism and an "America First" isolationism. The tenor and content of the speech left some diplomats "depressed," they said, and sparked an emergency meeting in Canada, one of the largest US trading partners. While some are stressing a need to wait and see what actions follow Trump's broad-brush rhetoric, international envoys and editorial pages also picked up on what the President didn't say -- his failure to reaffirm the traditional American role as a global leader of the international community. "The message was 'America First and screw everyone else,' " said one Arab diplomat. "That mind frame is not lost on the world and it is not good for the United States." A Western diplomat said Trump's speech on Friday transmitted to her country a message that the new US posture will be "America first and we will see about the rest of the world if we have time" -- a message that left people "depressed." Countries formally welcomed the new president and some quickly issued Trump invitations or accepted them. Israeli President Reuven Rivlin published a letter inviting Trump to visit, while British officials said Prime Minister Theresa May "This will primarily be an opportunity to get to know one another and to establish the basis for a productive working relationship," May's office said in a statement. "The leaders are expected to discuss a number of the most pressing global issues, notably tackling terrorism, Syria, relations with Russia and cooperation in NATO." Indonesia's president, Joko Widodo, congratulated Trump, saying of their phone call, "President Trump said Indonesia-US relations will certainly be better because President Trump said he has many friends in Indonesia, and has business interests in Indonesia." A Russian spokesman said President Vladimir Putin will call Trump in the coming days. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Saturday on Russia's Channel One network that this was a "diplomatic necessity" given various US-Russia issues, including nuclear disarmament and Syria. "The acting administration will have to be introduced to all the nuances of our bilateral ties," he said. Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev downplayed the possibility that sanctions on Russia could be lifted soon, saying they would likely last for a long time and that Russia shouldn't rely on the arrival of new heads of foreign governments to change that. "It is time to part with illusions that the sanctions will be lifted. Apparently, they will last long," Medvedev said Sunday during his speech at the convention of Russia's ruling party "United Russia" in Moscow. A spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said Monday of the future of US-China relations, "We should respect each other's core interests and major concerns, handle and manage our disagreements constructively to avoid letting them disrupt the overall relationship." German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said Sunday, "As with every transition of power there are uncertainties, doubt and question marks about the direction the new administration is taking ... I know we have to prepare for uncertain times as well as the unexpected and unknown. But I am counting on finding open ears in Washington who know that even big countries need partners in this world and who are ready to take their course together with good friends and established partners." Trump's inaugural remarks on Friday, which clocked in under 20 minutes, skated over familiar campaign themes, some put more baldly than others. He said protectionism would lead to strength, blasted other countries for the economic woes of the US, questioned the investment in security alliances, and painted a dark picture of weak borders that allow the US to be pillaged by "the ravages of other countries." The Times of London, a conservative paper owned by Rupert Murdoch, said in an editorial that the President painted a "bleak" picture of "American carnage." The left-leaning Guardian, on its editorial pages, called the speech "by turns bitter, blowhard and banal" and noted that "in 1933, Roosevelt challenged the world to overcome fear. In 2017, Mr Trump told the world to be very afraid." Among the slew of leaders quickly reaching out to Trump to try to establish a relationship with the new administration was Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto. The southern US border is an intense focus for Trump, who has promised to build a wall there and have Mexico pay for it. Pena Nieto's congratulatory call Saturday morning stressed Mexico's willingness to work on an agenda that would benefit both countries, according to his office, as well as the need to focus on respect for sovereignty and shared responsibility. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said that Trump and Pena Nieto "talked about a visit on trade, immigration and security" that is to occur on January 31. It's unclear where the meeting will take place. Mexico, the US and Canada form the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Trump, in a statement posted on the White House website Friday, pledged to unilaterally withdraw from if the other two nations don't agree to renegotiate the pact. On Monday, Trump began the process of unravleing the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also called Trump on Saturday to stress the importance of Canada-US ties and remind Trump that 35 states count Canada as their top destination for exports. Trudeau had to calm the frayed nerves of Canadian provincial leaders in a Friday phone call with them. Canada is the US' second-largest trading partner after China, with more than 70% of Canadian exports going to the US. The Prime Minister's office said he spoke to the leaders about efforts to find common ground with the new US administration. Diplomats said Trump's inaugural speech left them deeply concerned about the US commitment to international security networks and organizations like NATO, particularly given Trump's assertion that the US had "subsidized the armies of other countries while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military." Trump has dismissed NATO, seen as the core US security alliance, as "obsolete" and questioned whether the US should continue to lend security support to South Korea and Japan, both of which pay for that help. And he has unsettled friends and foes alike in 140-character blasts on Twitter. Diplomats said they were looking to the inaugural speech for reassurance that the US remains anchored in its commitment to allies. Instead, said the Western diplomat, after Trump's speech the feeling was that "we are surprised" and noted Trump's top foreign policy goal -- destroying ISIS. "If they are serious about fighting ISIS, how does that work?" the official asked. "American leadership will be important and we didn't hear that international context. This wasn't a speech to the world or even all Americans. It was a campaign speech to his base, to people that voted for him, that said nothing about US leadership. Talking about fear and carnage is not going to give a nice picture of what the US is going to do in the world." Several diplomats said they were disappointed by Trump's remarks, billing them as a missed opportunity for the new president to appear like a statesman and reach out to the world with a positive vision. "Disappointing would be putting it nicely," one diplomat added. Another diplomat, when asked about the speech, laughed. The diplomat would say only, "It's going to be very difficult" working with the new administration if the strategy Trump laid out Friday prevails. ©Swelling music and angry rhetoric, straight from the Donald Trump inauguration playbook, were prominent Saturday as Europe's nationalist parties gathered under the banner "Europe of Nations and Freedom" -- their political bloc in the European Union parliament. The big stars: Le Pen led the charge with a speech that promised an end to the European Union. She described the EU as a monstrous "chimera" and an "anti-democratic oligarchy" that France needed to leave. "The day after my election, I will address the European Union and ask for the return of our four sovereign powers," she said, naming them as territory, currency, economy and legislative. "Without those there is no freedom for the people and no capacity to implement the necessary reforms," Le Pen said. "Because it is not about allowing a self-declared supranational structure to remove the laws that the people decided on." She also cited similarities between Trump's inauguration speech and the message of the conference leaders to reclaim national sovereignty. The conference opened, not with soaring words, but a sharp attack on the media that set an unnerving note: Marcus Pretzel of the far-right Alternative For Germany (AFD), singled out the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper and several other local German media, which had been excluded from the conference, to make clear they were not welcome. The crowd responded with wild applause and chants of "luggenpresse" or "lying press" -- the German catchphrase used in Nazi propaganda to smash dissent. There were a few hundred in attendance, mostly AFD supporters. They cheered on their candidate, Frauke Petry, with shouts of "Merkel must go." German Chancellor Angela Merkel was the second most talked about leader in the speeches, after US President Donald Trump. While Merkel's decision to allow in hundreds of thousand of a refugees last year was deemed "catastrophic," Trump, on the other hand, was hailed for his victory in the presidential election. Petry's speech was more philosophical, rather than a rousing campaign speech, but she made clear that opposing immigration was her priority: "Mass migration is sold to us as 'diversity.' Well, we don't want this 'diversity' that Brussels dictates to us." "Together with patriots of Europe, the nation state will come back," Petry told the crowd. "But we have to be courageous to rethink Europe and Europe's freedom." It was the notoriously But, just as in the United States against Trump's inauguration, large counter-protests were mobilized against the message of the conference. While delegates applauded Le Pen, Wilders and Petry inside the conference venue, thousands of protesters outside chanted "Neo-nazis out!" and promised to continue demonstrating throughout the elections this year. It may or may not become the so-called "Year of the Patriots," but it will almost certainly be a It may or may not become the so-called "Year of the Patriots," but it will almost certainly be a ©The Justice Department concluded Friday that Jared Kushner serving in his father-in-law's administration would not be a violation of federal anti-nepotism laws. "In choosing his personal staff, the President enjoys an unusual degree of freedom, which Congress found suitable to the demands of his office," wrote Daniel Koffsky, deputy assistant attorney general in the DOJ Office of Legal Counsel, which serves as interpreter of federal law for the White House. In essence, Koffsky reasoned that the anti-nepotism law covers only appointments in an "executive" agency and that the White House Office is not an executive agency within the law. He cited a separate law that gives the President broad powers to hire his staff. That law authorizes the president to appoint "employees in the White House office without regard to any other provision of law regulating the employment or compensation of persons in the government service." The argument is in line with the interpretation put forward by Kushner's attorney, Jamie S. Gorelick, earlier in the week. "The appointment of Jared Kushner, President-elect Donald Trump's son-in-law, as a White House senior adviser is clearly lawful under this authority," Gorelick wrote in The New York Times earlier this week. A person familiar with the issue told CNN that Trump's transition team asked career lawyers with the DOJ Office of Legal Counsel to review the proposed Kushner appointment. Another source familiar with the matter said Koffsky is a longtime career attorney at OLC. The person familiar with the issue said political appointees of the DOJ, including Attorney General Loretta Lynch, did not play any role in the opinion. A transition source told CNN earlier this month that Kushner, who is married to the President's daughter Ivanka, will be senior adviser to the president. Kushner, a 36-year-old Harvard-educated businessman, was a key political strategist on Trump's election. But federal anti-nepotism laws brought into question whether he could continue his influence in the President's life post-election. Trump -- along with many of his Cabinet nominees -- has repeatedly been criticized for conflict of interest. But the Justice Department downplayed those concerns in this specific hire. "A President wanting a relative's advice on governmental matters therefore has a choice: to seek that advice on an unofficial, ad hoc basis without conferring the status and imposing the responsibilities that accompany formal White House positions; or to appoint his relative to the White House under title 3 and subject him to substantial restrictions against conflicts of interest," Koffsky wrote. "We believe that the President's special hiring authority in 3 U.S.C. xc2xa7 105(a) permits him to make appointments to the White House Office that the anti-nepotism statute might otherwise forbid," Koffsky wrote. He acknowledged that while his conclusion "departs" from "prior work" of the Office of Legal Counsel, "this departure is fully justified." In a statement, Gorelick said, "We believed that we had the better argument on this. The Office of Legal Counsel of the Justice Department -- in an opinion by a highly regarded career Deputy Assistant Attorney General -- adopted a position consistent with our own." ©Rep. Luis Gutierrez, one of dozens of Democratic lawmakers who boycotted Donald Trump's inauguration, said Saturday that the new president has not yet earned his respect. "Donald Trump has to earn my respect, has to earn my being reciprocal," the Illinois lawmaker told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. "When he spoke yesterday and said 'America First,' did he include me? Did he include my grandsons?" More than 50 Democratic lawmakers boycotted Trump's inauguration. Some promised to participate in anti-Trump demonstrations around the country. Trump called for unity Friday in his inauguration speech. "It is time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will never forget: That whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots, we all enjoy the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great American Flag," he said. But Gutierrez said Trump's calls for nationalism weren't inclusive. "That's not the way it felt yesterday. Yesterday it felt different," he told Blitzer. Democrats and immigrant rights activists criticized Trump during the presidential campaign for his views on immigration and his rhetoric about Hispanics. In the speech launching his bid, he called some Mexican immigrants murderers and rapists. Gutierrez, who is participating in Saturday's women's march, is calling on Trump to have more respect for the issues that impact historically marginalized groups. "I'm going to help the American people by marching with my wife today in Washington, D.C.," he said. "We have to stand up first for the foundation of our democracy." "I'm going to help the American people by marching with my wife today in Washington, D.C.," he said.

"It took this horrific moment of darkness to wake us the f--k up," she told the crowd. "It seems as though we had all slipped into a false sense of comfort, that justice would prevail and that good would win in the end." "Well, good did not win this election. But good will win in the end," she said. The pop star later went into a rendition of "Human Nature" with added R-rated lyrics, including a call for Trump to perform an obscene act to himself. Madonna, who But of those high-profile speeches, Madonna's was particularly confrontational. She said that the march represented the beginning of a "revolution" and affirmed that "we will not back down." "And to our detractors that insist that this march will never add up to anything: F--k you. F--k you," she said. "It is the beginning of much-needed change." Madonna also said she was "angry" and "outraged" in the wake of Trump's inauguration. "Yes, I'm angry. Yes, I am outraged. Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House," Madonna said. "But I know that this won't change anything. We cannot fall into despair." "Yes, I'm angry. Yes, I am outraged. Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House," Madonna said. "But I know that this won't change anything. We cannot fall into despair." ©More than a million Americans took to the streets of the United States to protest Donald Trump the day after his inauguration. And that doesn't include the many thousands of people who took part in the main event -- The Women's March on Washington -- for which there was no official crowd estimate. CNN did not make its own crowd estimates, but compiled official estimates from law enforcement agencies for many of the "sister marches" around the country that drew large crowds. There were other marches in cities around the world. Marchers planned events in many cities outside the nation's capitol. CNN looked at media reports citing law enforcement figures in many of those cities. Crowd sizes became an issue in Washington Saturday when Trump visited the CIA and during remarks to employees there, accused an unnamed news organization of misrepresenting the attendance for his own inauguration. "We had a massive field of people," he told the US intelligence agency. "You saw that. Packed. I get up this morning, I turn on one of the networks, and they show an empty field. I'm like, wait a minute. I made a speech. I looked out, the field was, it looked like a million, million and a half people. They showed a field where there were practically nobody standing there. And they said, 'Donald Trump did not draw well,' " the President said. "It looked honestly like a million and a half people, whatever it was, it was, but it went all the way back to the Washington Monument and I turn on, by mistake, I get this network, and it showed an empty field. Said we drew 250,000 people. Now, that's not bad. But it's a lie," he said. It wasn't clear which outlet Trump was referring to. CNN has not reported a specific size to the crowd since there has been no official estimate. Later, White House press secretary Sean Spicer went on a tear against the political press for reporting on crowd size. The National Park Service, which oversees the National Mall, has been instructed by Congress not to offer crowd size estimates. "This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period," Photos of Trump's inauguration compared to Barack Obama's in 2009 and also to the Women's March suggest the President drew a smaller crowd, although there could be other reasons, including a heightened security perimeter on Friday for the inauguration that was not in place on Saturday for the Women's March and protesters on Friday, who obstructed entrance points to the inauguration and parade route. ©President Donald Trump's pick to run the CIA, Rep. Mike Pompeo, has told Congress that he would consider bringing back waterboarding and other enhanced interrogation measures under certain circumstances. In a "If confirmed, I will consult with experts at the Agency and at other organizations in the US government on whether the Army Field Manual uniform application is an impediment to gathering vital intelligence to protect the country," he wrote. While Pompeo acknowledged interrogation practices like waterboarding are illegal under current law, he did not rule out seeking to have those laws modified. "If experts believed current law was an impediment to gathering vital intelligence to protect the country, I would want to understand such impediments and whether any recommendations were appropriate for changing current law," he said. The revelation comes as Trump is due to visit CIA headquarters Saturday. The CIA is currently without a chief, as the Senate During his confirmation hearings, Pompeo offered a less nuanced response when asked about the revival of torture interrogation techniques. "Absolutely not," he responded when asked if he would restart the program if ordered to do so by Trump. "Moreover, I can't imagine I would be asked that by the President-elect." Pompeo told lawmakers they had his "full commitment" that the CIA was out of the torture business. In 2014, Pompeo had supported the use of enhanced interrogation techniques publicly in Congress. In his most recent responses to questions on the subject, Pompeo declined to address the effectiveness of such techniques, writing, "I understand the disagreement over the past use of waterboarding and whether information could have been obtained through other less coercive methods." He went on to cite a public CIA study conducted during the Obama administration that found while the program had obtained intelligence, it was "unknowable" whether that information could have been acquired through other means. Ret. Gen. John Kelly, Donald Trump's newly confirmed Secretary of Homeland Security, told the Senate he would "absolutely" abide by US laws prohibiting the use of waterboarding and other forms of torture, breaking with Trump's campaign promise to bring back waterboarding and "worse" forms of torture in the fight against terrorism. "I don't think we should ever come close to crossing a line that is beyond what we as Americans would expect to follow in terms of interrogation techniques," he said, agreeing that the Geneva Conventions should continue to serve as a guide for the US. And in an interview with The New York Times Trump said that his defense secretary, Ret. Gen. James Mattis, told him that waterboarding was not an effective tactic, saying he had better luck with "a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers."

Many of the facts he cited, however, are inaccurate. Here's a look at some of Spicer's claims. "(The National Park Service) used a similar grass protective layer in 2013," a former senior Interior Department official told CNN Saturday, asking that his name not be used. "The security perimeter for this inauguration was extended due to lessons learned and world events," a Secret Service spokesperson said. "Security fencing was placed around the National Mall this inauguration. There were seven access points where bag checks only were conducted." The spokesperson added that magnetometers -- which includes hand wands -- also weren't used. The length of his standing ovation, however, isn't precisely known. The camera feed of the room was cut shortly after Trump finished to protect the identity of some of the national security officials in the crowd. While audio of the feed persisted for a minute or so later, music played over the sound and it wasn't clear how long the applause lasted. Reporters were also moved from the room as the ovation was ongoing. Trump departed the CIA about six minutes after he finished speaking. ©The chairman of Donald Trump's Inaugural Committee, Tom Barrack Jr., says he thinks it was appropriate for the President to use his speech to the CIA as an opportunity to complain about reports on the crowd size at his inauguration. "There is nobody that feels stronger about the intelligence community and the CIA than Donald Trump, there is nobody," Trump said. But he also spent time telling the hundreds of CIA employees that the media were among "the most dishonest human beings on Earth" and accused television stations of lying about the crowd size at his inauguration Friday. "I think it's appropriate," Barrack, a longtime friend to Trump, said on CNN's show "Smerconish" Saturday. "He talked to them like he would to a rally group instead of the protocol, what everyone was anticipating might be done to an Intelligence community," he said, speculating that the approach was what people found upsetting "But the consistency of the man is he gave them straight talk," he said. Former CIA Director Brennan released a statement about the speech in which he said he was "deeply saddened and angered at Donald Trump's despicable display of self-aggrandizement in front of CIA's Memorial Wall of Agency heroes." Brennan added that Trump "should be ashamed of himself." Barrack told Smerconish that the crowd sizes are not "worthy" of all the media scrutiny, and gave a rationale behind Trump's thinking. "I think what upset him was the tweeting. In other words, if he's criticized for tweeting and being irresponsible on the set of facts, than he holds the press equally accountable. This all started from a tweet," Barrack explains. "It got started from a tweet from a New York Times reporter that got retweeted by the National Park Services." The agency was temporarily asked to halt their Twitter activities, Smerconish advised Barrack talk to President Trump, suggesting that he say, "Mr. President, you can't engage CIA personnel in a conversation about crowd size at your inauguration. Or, trash the media in front of the CIA. For goodness sakes, you're standing in front of a wall where we're paying homage to those that we've lost in service to their country. Can you say that, and do you say that to him?" "He would accept that a thousand percent," Barrack said. "He got a standing ovation from all of the CIA staff because I think they finally felt the personality of the man."

The first family is also adjusting to life in their new roles as first lady, first sons, first daughters and first grandchildren. Following the inaugural ball festivities Friday night, Tiffany and boyfriend Ross Mechanic; Donald Jr., wife Vanessa and daughter Kai; and Eric and wife Lara split off from the presidential motorcade and headed to the Trump International Hotel DC, where they were spotted celebrating the day with a midnight balloon drop with friends and family. Marla Maples, mother of Tiffany and Trump's second wife, posted an Instagram with her daughter and some friends from the luxurious lobby bar, The Benjamin. Saturday morning, the entire Trump clan dressed up and joined the President and Vice President Mike Pence for a church service at the National Cathedral in Northwest Washington. Then it was time to check out the new digs at the White House. Trump's new home has 132 rooms, 35 bathrooms and six levels in the residence, per the office of the curator, and there's a lot to explore. Some family members went bowling. Donald Jr. posted a photo of wife and daughter Saturday afternoon in the White House basement's alley. "Family bowling session at The White House," he tweeted. They may have also checked out the South Lawn and its view of the Washington Monument, or the movie theater, the pool, the rose garden, or the basketball court. Hungry? The White House chefs -- who have, so far, stayed on from the Obama administration -- have stocked the fridge with the Trump family's favorite snacks. The current White House executive chef has been feeding presidents and their families since George W. Bush, and started in the White House kitchen under President Bill Clinton. President Trump himself is a fast-food aficionado -- he told CNN's Anderson Cooper at a CNN town hall last February that he loves McDonald's. "A fish delight sometimes, right? The Big Macs are great. The Quarter Pounder. It's great stuff." He tweeted a photo from his plane with a bucket of KFC during the campaign. "Not the worst thing in the world," he told Cooper of the fried chicken. Generally, the family will provide the White House with individual preferences and dietary restrictions. President Barack Obama famously snacked on almonds in the White House. The New York Times In 2009, it was a top priority for incoming First Lady Michelle Obama to settle young daughters Sasha and Malia into their new rooms and make the White House a home as smoothly as possible. This new administration is different, as First Lady Melania Trump and son Barron Trump won't be living in Washington full-time until the end of the school year, and most of Trump's grown children will continue to live in New York City. It was not immediately clear how long the New York-based Trumps will stick around town -- but as the President gets to work, his full house will diminish. The first lady will return to New York with Barron, 10, in time for school on Monday. Eric and Donald Jr., along with their families, are also expected to return to New York, as Trump's adult sons will run the Trump Organization while their father is in office. Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, who will serve as senior adviser to the President, will live in Washington full-time. Last week, movers were spotted unloading furniture at their new home in DC's Kalorama neighborhood, just a couple miles from the White House. Ivanka Trump, who does not yet have a formal role in the White House but served as a key adviser to her father's campaign, posted on Facebook earlier this month that she was planning to take time to settle their three young children into their new home and schools.

The National Park Service Twitter account retweeted this After the retweet began to get attention, a career staffer at the Interior Department instructed employees that the "new administration has said that the department and all bureau are not supposed to tweet this weekend and wait for guidance until Monday." The message continued, "Please make sure that any scheduled tweets are no longer scheduled," and referred all questions to another career staffer at the department. On Saturday, the National Park Service called Friday's retweets "mistaken." "We regret the mistaken RTs from our account yesterday and look forward to continuing to share the beauty and history of our parks with you," A Park Service source tells CNN the decision to stop tweeting was in order to investigate whether or not the account had been hacked. The agency does not share crowd size estimates, dating back to controversy over the Million Man March in 1995. New social media guidance issued Saturday cited an "abundance of caution." "Out of an abundance of caution, while we investigated the situation involving these tweets, the Department's communications team determined that it was important to stand down Twitter activity across the Department temporarily, except in the case of public safety," the new guidance states. "Now that social media guidance has been clarified, the Department and its bureaus should resume Twitter engagement as normal this weekend, with the exception of social media posts on the Secretary's policy priorities, which will be outlined upon confirmation." Trump's nominee to lead the department, Montana Rep. Ryan Zinke, is expected to be confirmed in the near future.

A day after he set the tone for his term by delivering a searing inaugural address laced with the populist themes that helped him win the election, Trump offered new evidence that he will be as disdainful of convention and protocol as President as he was in the campaign trail. His broadside against the media, which he believes is unfairly representing the size of the crowd on Friday, and the sight of huge anti-Trump crowds in US cities and around the world also made another thing clear: the political acrimony that rattled the nation for the past 18 months is not going away. Trump traveled to the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, for a briefing from senior agency leaders and spoke to several hundred people in the spy agency's foyer, in front of a hallowed spot: the wall of honor where fallen operatives are remembered with stars. "This is my first stop officially, there is nobody that feels stronger about the intelligence community and the CIA than Donald Trump, there is nobody," Trump said. "I am so behind you and I know that maybe sometimes you haven't got the backing that you wanted." The gesture of the visit was an important moment for Trump, who raised doubts about his relationship with US intelligence agencies by initially casting doubt on their assessment that Russia intervened in the election by hacking Democratic email accounts. He had also spurred anxiety about his willingness to accept traditional presidential daily briefings on the gravest security threats facing the United States. His comments were warmly received by CIA employees who came in on a Saturday to see their new president. But Trump also departed from his topic, turning the event into a campaign-like appearance. He complained about the media's treatment of him and accused television stations of not being truthful about the size of the crowd on Friday. "I have a running war with the media, they are among the most dishonest human beings on Earth -- they sort of made it sound like I had a feud with the intelligence community. The reason you are the number one stop is exactly the opposite," he said. Later, White House press secretary Sean Spicer appeared in the White House briefing room to warn the administration was going to hold the press "accountable" and argued that the Trump crowd was the largest inaugural crowd ever. He said any suggestion otherwise was "shameful and wrong." Spicer then left the room after the statement without taking questions. The White House appeared irked by cameras that showed large gaps in Trump's still large crowd on Friday compared to the one that showed historic numbers of spectators to see former President Barack Obama sworn in for his first term in 2009. The chairman of Trump's inaugural committee, Tom Barrack, told CNN's Michael Smerconish that Trump was disappointed at what he saw as deceptive photos of the crowd that appeared on Twitter. "I think it's appropriate because this president is just putting his fingerprint on what it's going to be like for him to be president. It's the same consistency of straight talk," Barrack said. The spat was another reminder of Trump's deep sensitivity to criticism and to any suggestion that his popularity or election victory are not entirely legitimate. As Trump adjusted to the reality of power, those opposed to his presidency sent their own message, as a huge crowd gathered in Washington for a women's march and demonstrators also thronged cities including Chicago, Boston and Seattle. Protests also took place across the world, including in Sydney, Australia, London, Paris and Berlin. The President's motorcade passed some of the protesters as he left the White House for the CIA. The protests were part of a grassroots organizing effort meant to demonstrate a show of force to the new administration that women's rights are human rights and to stress respect for racial, gender and political diversity that organizers say were threatened by Trump's campaign. The plan had been to march on the White House but the larger-than-expected crowd in Washington clogged the planned route. At another big rally in Boston, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said Trump's presidency should serve as a rallying point for progressives. "Yesterday, Donald Trump was sworn in as President. That sight is now burned into my eyes forever and I hope the same is true for you," Warren told the crowd. "We will not forget, we don't want to forget. We will use that vision to make sure we fight harder, we fight tougher and we fight more passionately than ever." Earlier, at Washington's National Cathedral, Trump took part in the traditional inauguration prayer service, as clergy from various faiths including Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism and Islam offer prayers for his administration and the nation. In his opening prayer, the Very Reverend Randolph Marshall Hollerith, the dean of Washington National Cathedral, appeared to be making a point about the need for unity after the bitter, divisive election campaign that made Trump president. "Look with compassion on the whole human family; take away the arrogance and hatred which infect our hearts; break down the walls that separate us; unite us in bonds of love; and work through our struggle and confusion to accomplish your purposes on earth; that, in your good time, all nations and races may serve you in harmony around your heavenly throne through Jesus Christ our Lord," Hollerith said, reciting an excerpt from the Book of Common Prayer. Trump, who was accused of discrimination against followers of Islam throughout the campaign, also sat quietly as a Muslim prayer echoed through the nave. Imam Mohamed Magid, executive director of the All Dulles Area Muslim Society, had been expected to deliver the Islamic call to prayer, The President did not speak at the service. Trump was still buzzing on Saturday morning after the day of ceremony the day before. "A fantastic day and evening in Washington D.C.Thank you to @FoxNews and so many other news outlets for the GREAT reviews of the speech!" Trump said in the first tweet from his personal Twitter account of his presidency. Hours earlier, he swept into several inaugural balls with First Lady Melania Trump, and the couple danced to Frank Sinatra's "My Way." The President told the crowd at one event that even people who had not been nice to him said "we did a really good job today. They hated to it but they did it. And I respect that. I respect that." The impact of Trump's inaugural address was reverberating around the world on Saturday. Foreign newspapers narrowed in on the nationalistic turn in US foreign policy. "Trump offers fearful vision as he promises 'America First,'" the Irish Times said in a front page splash. The Dawn newspaper in Pakistan highlighted Trump's inaugural vow to unite the world against "radical Islamic terrorism." One of the world's most important leaders, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, pledged to work with Trump to find "compromises and solutions" on the basis of mutual respect. Asked at a news conference about Trump's address and its America-first tone, she said: "I believe firmly that it is best for all of us if we work together based on rules, common values and joint action in the international economic system, in the international trade system, and make our contributions to the military alliances." "And second, the trans-Atlantic relationship will not be less important in the coming years than it was in past years." Trump raised eyebrows in an interview while he was still President-elect in which he said he had similar levels of respect for Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is widely regarded as a US enemy in Washington. Before spending his first night in the White House, Trump moved quickly to consolidate his power and to make an immediate break with the Obama administration. He signed an executive order that will begin the process of chipping away at the Affordable Care Act, the centerpiece of former President Barack Obama's domestic legacy. The 45th President also signed documents validating the appointments of his newly confirmed cabinet members Defense Secretary James Mattis and Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly. Other cabinet picks, including the incoming CIA director Mike Pompeo, are expected to receive votes from Monday, though partisan wrangling is still delaying many cabinet appointments. White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus sent out a memo to all government agencies and departments calling for a freeze on new regulations.

Trump spent much of his speech -- which he gave in front of a memorial wall that honors the 117 CIA officers who have fallen in the line of duty -- focusing on the size of the crowd size at his inauguration, his appearance on magazine covers and saying he "has a running war with the media." "Former CIA Director Brennan is deeply saddened and angered at Donald Trump's despicable display of self-aggrandizement in front of CIA's Memorial Wall of Agency heroes," Nick Shapiro said in a statement. "Brennan says that Trump should be ashamed of himself." One source who attended Trump's appearance said many people there were troubled by the political aspect of the remarks, in which the president speculated about how many people in the room may have voted for him. "We are not political in that way," the source said. "Talking about whether we voted for Trump is offensive and foreign to us by the president ... Many people felt used and awkward throughout. Of course there was applause, but it was uncomfortable." Trump's visit, his first official one since becoming President, was seen as part of a bid to mend fences after he strained relations with intelligence officials by repeatedly casting doubt on their assessment that Russia had carried out cyberattacks during the campaign. He also suggested that the intelligence community was leaking information about the investigation to the press, taking to Twitter to slam Brennan, a 25-year veteran of the agency. The President sought to send a message of support to the intelligence community following the turbulent transition, telling the 300 employees in attendance, "I am so behind you." "I am with you 1,000%," Trump said after receiving intelligence briefings from top agency officials. "There is nobody that feels stronger about the intelligence community and the CIA than Donald Trump," he said to applause, adding at the end of his remarks, "I love you. I respect you. We're going to start winning again, and you're going to be leading the charge." Trump blamed the "dishonest" media for the perceived rift with the intelligence community. Many observers had commented on the unmatched level of skepticism Trump had directed at the US intelligence apparatus, and other speakers Saturday addressed the relationship between presidents and the intelligence community. "CIA's relationship with the president has been essential to our nation's strength and security," acting director Meroe Park said prior to introducing Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. "I can assure you this new President and our entire team recognizes and appreciates the sacrifices of all of the men and women of the intelligence community of the United States of America," Pence told the assembled group. Trump echoed Pence's praise but drew the ire of Brennan as well as Democrats for using the platform to address political issues entirely unrelated to the CIA. The backlash from a agency veteran like Brennan could undermine Trump's latest push to foster a strong relationship between the White House and the intelligence community. The President did take a moment to acknowledge the memorial behind him, saying, "The wall behind me is very, very special." Trump also spoke about his desire to "eradicate radical Islamic terrorism ... off the face of the earth. This is evil." And he said about Iraq, "We should have kept the oil. Maybe we'll have another chance." But Trump's off-the-cuff remarks veered into political territory at times, something not typically seen in addresses to intelligence professionals who pride themselves on being non-partisan and which drew a quick attack from Democrats. The CIA audience was separated into two sections: a main area of all agency staff and a separate section directly in front of the stage that consisted of senior agency leadership, including agents. During Trump's address, the senior leadership stood the entire time. When Trump began drifting into political topics, the main crowd broke into cheers and applause at points. The senior leadership remained stoic, and did not applaud the political lines. The president also repeatedly slammed the media, saying, "I have a running war with the media" and accusing news organizations of misrepresenting the size of the crowds at his inauguration speech on Friday. He talked about the number of times he has been on the cover of Time magazine. The ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee issued a statement shortly after Trump's visit ripping the new president. "While standing in front of the stars representing CIA personnel who lost their lives in the service of their country -- hallowed ground -- Trump gave little more than a perfunctory acknowledgment of their service and sacrifice," Rep. Adam Schiff said, adding that Trump "meandered through a variety of other topics unrelated to intelligence." "He will need to do more than use the agency memorial as a backdrop if he wants to earn the respect of the men and women who provide the best intelligence in the world," Schiff added. The visit comes amid questions regarding the status of Trump's choice to run the agency, Rep. Mike Pompeo. The CIA, currently being led by Park, is lacking a permanent chief as the Senate has delayed Pompeo's confirmation vote until Monday, with Democrats citing concerns about his positions on surveillance and other issues. Pompeo, who was at the CIA with Trump, has encountered some controversy after he submitted responses to a Senate questionnaire where he said he would consider bringing back waterboarding and other enhanced interrogation measures under certain circumstances. Republicans have slammed the delay, with Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas issuing a statement, saying, "The Democrats are obstructing the nomination of Mike Pompeo as CIA director for no good reason." "I hope the jihadists take the weekend off from trying to kill Americans," Cotton added.

Luis Villarroel had parked his limo on K Street after dropping off a client when he heard a loud noise. "There were these boys who had covered their faces with masks" who had surrounded the car, Villarroel told CNN Saturday. A woman signaled to him to get out of the limo, and by the time Villarroel exited, "they were already hammering my car." As he moved away, people were throwing things at him, including a sandwich. Someone set a small fire inside the limo, causing Villarroel to rush back to the car to stomp it out. Police then arrived at the scene and told Villarroel to leave, saying the situation was getting dangerous. The company for which he works, Nationwide Chauffeured Services, sent another car to pick him and his client up. Soon after, protesters set another fire to the limo, which quickly spread to the rest of the vehicle, engulfing it in flames. Vito Maggiolo, a spokesman for DC Fire, told CNN he was unable to provide further details about the incident. Majid Rafique, a spokesman for the chauffeur company, said it was not clear how much it was going to cost the company to replace the limo, saying he was waiting for the insurance company's assessment. Villarroel, who has driven a limo for 25 years, only suffered a minor cut on his finger during the incident but was otherwise unharmed. By Saturday, he was back at work, driving a bus for the company. "These things don't scare me," he said. Six police officers were injured and 217 protesters were arrested throughout the day Friday after a morning of peaceful protests and coordinated disruptions of Trump's inauguration ceremony gave way to ugly street clashes in downtown Washington. Anti-Trump protests also broke out Friday in US cities, including New York, Seattle, Dallas, Chicago and Portland, Oregon. Authorities in Seattle say one person was in critical condition at a hospital with a gunshot wound. Demonstrations also took place overseas in Hong Kong, Berlin and London.

RELATED: Get full coverage of the But there's going to be a lot of conjecture about it. Trump himself talked about his massive crowds during an appearance at the Armed Services Ball Friday night. It's clear that both events attracted many people. Below are pictures from 12:15 p.m. ET on each day from the Trump talked about crowd size during an appearance at the CIA Saturday and argued the size of his crowds had been misrepresented. "We had a massive field of people," he told the US intelligence agency. "You saw that. Packed. I get up this morning, I turn on one of the networks, and they show an empty field. I'm like, wait a minute. I made a speech. I looked out, the field was, it looked like a million, million and a half people. They showed a field where there were practically nobody standing there. And they said, Donald Trump did not draw well," the President said. "It looked honestly like a million and a half people, whatever it was, it was, but it went all the way back to the Washington Monument and I turn on, by mistake, I get this network, and it showed an empty field. Said we drew 250,000 people. Now, that's not bad. But it's a lie. We had 250,000 people," he said. It wasn't clear which outlet Trump was referring to. CNN has not reported a specific size to the crowd since there has been no official estimate. Trump took the oath of office just before noon Friday and then gave his inaugural address. A rally associated with the march was slated for between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. on Saturday. Some differences to note: Trump's speech was on the West Front of the Capitol, which was at capacity on Friday. It was cordoned off and empty on Saturday as protesters gathered on the Mall. On the other hand, the Women's March filled the streets around the mall. Those streets were closed to Trump supporters. His inauguration was on Jan. 20, because of the Constitution, which this year occurred on a Friday. The Women's March was on Saturday, when more people are off work. Metro, Washington's subway system, tweeted Saturday there were 275,000 trips taken Saturday by 11 a.m. On Friday, there were 193,000 trips by 11 a.m., according to Metro. Another important point: Both events are occurring in an area opposed to Trump. Washington, D.C. voted overwhelmingly against Trump last November. He got just It should also be noted that marchers took to the streets in other cities, nationwide, and in cities around the world. "Sister marches" also took place in Chicago: And New York: And in Boston: Here are some of the best pictures from American cities: And images from other countries, too: ©Marches for women's rights in the United States and around the world amounted to a remarkable protest against Donald Trump on his first full day in office. The question going forward is whether the marches are simply a cathartic moment for people upset over Trump's election victory or a more enduring opposition movement. While the mood at the main march in Washington was mostly jovial, the day underscored some of the challenges facing the left in the aftermath of Trump's victory. It was not immediately clear what political impact the marches would have on the Trump administration or Republicans in Congress. Trump didn't address the march during remarks he delivered Saturday afternoon at CIA headquarters in Virginia. One central hurdle for protesters: their effort to draw attention to so many different political priorities. Even the signs they carried reflected the diversity of their agendas. Some were there advocating for Black Lives Matter movement while others aimed to bring attention to reproductive rights. Some focused on the fight for equal pay and their opposition to the rollback of former President Barack Obama's health care law. They also differed in their approach to influencing the new administration. Some women wore blue and white sashes that said "dissent is patriotic." Homemade signs and rainbow flags bore symbols of peace and love -- others emblazoned with the printed message "Women Won't Back Down." Many women in attendance also wore the now-famous T-shirts with hearts embracing Trump's phrase about Hillary Clinton: "Nasty Woman." Meanwhile, the Democratic mantra so prevalent in the final weeks of the campaign -- "when they go low, we go high" -- was largely absent. Actress Ashley Judd, for instance, read a poem that said Trump bathes in "Cheeto dust." Madonna delivered remarks laden with expletives. Dozens of older women held signs that said "I can't believe I still have to protest this s---." Many signs referenced to Trump's vulgar comments that emerged weeks before the election that reveal him bragging on a decade old tape about his ability to grab women by the genitals because of his fame. One protester held a sign that said "If you're going to grab my pussy, keep your hands off my healthcare." In interviews, marchers said they were hoping to maintain a positive vibe -- a respectful demonstration of democracy and expression of free speech. Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell said that some 7,500 people were coming from her home state of Michigan on 100 buses. Since the election, she said "People are showing up at any kind of activist meeting because they want to do something and they don't know what to do." "None of us are single issue voters," Dingell said. "We want to make sure Americans have quality, affordable health care, funding for Planned Parenthood and that women are treated fairly in the work place." She said she believes Trump is "a man who listens to how people feel." "I think he's a smart man, and I think he will see a movement. He will see women scared about what's going to happen to the country," Dingell said. The march has evolved organically from a post-election call to action on Facebook to an organized effort that included a roster of high-wattage activists and attendees including feminist Gloria Steinem, singer Katy Perry, actors America Ferrera, Ashley Judd and Scarlett Johansson. Leaders and activists from hundreds of left-leaning groups are joining the march, including the NAACP, Planned Parenthood, the American Federation of Teachers, as well as pro-immigrant and pro-environment groups. Margaret Huang, the executive director of Amnesty International USA, which is co-sponsoring the march, said the group's members were concerned about talk of a Muslim registry and Trump's "willingness to use policies to exclude particular communities." "These sorts of rhetorical commitments that (Trump) made on the campaign trail cannot become policy," she said. Mother and daughter Deborah and Maeve Kelly of New Jersey decided to attend the march after being deeply frustrated by the results of the November election. They left the Alice Paul Institute in Mount Laurel, New Jersey, at 6 a.m. ET on Saturday, and their group plans to return to New Jersey later in the evening. Deborah Kelly, 61 of Chesterfield Township, New Jersey, said she was inspired to march after being stunned by the number of women who voted for Trump in November. "I didn't feel like women were voting in their own interests," she said in a telephone interview before Saturday's event. "This march was a way to demonstrate to the public that there is a large group of women out there who feel that the rights and progress made over the last decade are really threatened and could be eroded." She encouraged her daughter to attend with her as part of the show of force by all generations: "We have to be very vigilant," Kelly said. "This is almost a symbolic passing of the torch to the younger generation, who have to be active to protect the rights that we have fought for." Maeve Kelly, 25 of Lambertville, New Jersey, said she didn't want American voters to forget about the comments Trump has made over the years judging women by their looks and their weight. "That's just something that really angers me, and I don't think it has any place in my world," she said in an interview. "It feels like everything we have worked toward, and all that suffragettes worked toward -- so we could vote and be successful -- is threatened now." The march, she said, is "mostly just a message of solidarity." "There are so many people traveling from all over the country to show that we are going to stand together and not let the President of our country bully us or make us feel like we don't belong," she said. "It's really just taking a stand for women's rights." ©The Women's March on Washington and other marches around the world as they happened live on January 21, 2017.

Many were clad in pink hats and waved protest signs. They raised their voices for women's rights, immigration and other civil rights. And they cheered on speakers who delivered impassioned -- and in at least one instance, profanity-laced -- rallying cries for the preservation of rights they said could be eroded under Donald Trump's presidency. Here are snippets of what some speakers had to say: ©More than one million people marched through Washington, D.C., and other American cities Saturday to show support for women's rights and express their discontent over the election of President Donald Trump. The Women's March drew members of Congress, world-famous actresses and countless citizens like Joanne Gascoyne of Albany, New York a 78-year-old retired teacher who traveled to New York City with her daughter and two granddaughters. "I feel people are afraid to vote for a woman for president," Gascoyne said. "I'm really here for women and to inspire my granddaughters to carry on." The protesters came out for a range of reasons, including immigration, health care and a general antipathy to Trump. But most said they wanted to show support for women and feared that there will be attacks on women's rights during Trump's presidency. CNN did not make its own crowd estimates, but Marches were also held in cities around the world. The biggest demonstration took place in Washington, where protesters filled Pennsylvania Avenue, the same street Trump walked down a day before during his inaugural parade. In the evening, the crowd moved toward the White House. On the mall, filmmaker Michael Moore, feminist icon Gloria Steinem, musician Alicia Keys and other speakers emotionally attacked Trump for his views on immigration, Muslims and women. "It took this horrific moment of darkness to wake us the f--k up," Madonna told the crowd. "It seems as though we had all slipped into a false sense of comfort, that justice would prevail and that good would win in the end." Historian Douglas Brinkley told CNN that people will always remember the inauguration and the march as momentous events. "It's big. It's a huge moment," Brinkley said. "It also reminded me, believe it or not, of V-J Day, Victory Over Japan Day, 1945. Because when victory came people started coming out of apartments and homes ... a lot of extra people in these towns just started coming out." March organizers said protests took place in more than 600 cities across the world. Attendance was not always easy to determine. For instance, Washington march organizers said about 500,000 people took part, but authorities did not confirm that number or provide their own estimate. In Boston, 120,000 to 125,000 people protested, according to a police aerial photo analysis cited by a senior Boston Police official. Police said the crowd there was too big for the march route and could not proceed because "it would be like a snake eating its tail." U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren urged Boston protesters to resist: "We can whimper. We can whine. Or we can fight back! We come here to stand shoulder to shoulder to make clear: We are here! We will not be silent! We will not play dead! We will fight for what we believe in!" In Los Angeles, more than 100,000 people marched, police said. So many people crammed into the streets that "our march turned into a stand," said Ellen Crafts, who handled public relations for the event. Demonstrators in New York City marched toward Trump Tower -- the President's main residence when he's not in the White House -- but were blocked at Fifth Avenue. Police said 20,000 people protested in Houston, 60,000 in Oakland. In Atlanta, 60,000 people marched with US Rep. John Lewis, a major Trump critic. CNN could not independently confirm any of these crowd estimates. Overall, the protesters were law-abiding, with police reporting only four arrests in 21 American cities. Nobody was arrested in Washington. "Sister marches" happened outside the United States, too. People gathered to demonstrate in most major cities around the world, including London; Tel Aviv; Melbourne, Australia; Pristina, Kosovo; Moscow; Berlin and Mexico City -- often in front of US embassies. In Athens, Greece, protesters included refugees from Elliniko Camp, located in the old Athens airport. There was The march organizers believe more people came out Saturday for the protests than for Trump's inaugural events on Friday. Washington protest organizers, who originally sought a permit for a gathering of 200,000, said Saturday that as many as a half million people participated, dwarfing Friday's inaugural crowd. More than 470,000 people had taken the Metro, the Washington subway system, by 1 p.m., a weekend ridership record. The metro tweeted Saturday there were 275,000 trips taken Saturday by 11 a.m. By comparison, on Friday, there were 193,000 trips by 11 a.m., according to Metro. Not everyone agrees. Trump, "I get up this morning, I turn on one of the networks, and they show an empty field. I'm like, wait a minute. I made a speech. I looked out, the field was, it looked like a million, million and a half people. They showed a field where there were practically nobody standing there. And they said, Donald Trump did not draw well," the President said. Trump said the unnamed network reported he drew 250,000 people. "Now, that's not bad," Trump said. "But it's a lie," adding that the inauguration drew significantly more than 250,000 people. Later Saturday, But Metro confirms numbers first reported in the Washington Post showing that 570,557 riders took trips between the subway system's opening at 4 a.m. Friday through its closing at midnight. The numbers are lower than what the system saw in 2009 and 2013 during Obama's inaugurations: 1.1 million trips in 2009 and 782,000 in 2013. The protesters, which included many men, hit the streets for different reasons, among them health care, the future of the Affordable Care Act, the environment and income equality. But Trump's stated attitudes toward women and his comments about judging women by their weight and appearance kept coming up, as did "That's just something that really angers me, and I don't think it has any place in my world," Maeve Kelly, 25 of Lambertville, New Jersey.

"The fact that saying these things which are usually accepted by every American met the displeasure of the crowd doesn't speak too kindly of that crowd," Schumer, a New York Democrat, told CNN's Jake Tapper on "State of the Union." "Just the people who booed," Schumer quickly added. "I'm sure it wasn't most of them." In a speaking slot minutes before Trump, Schumer had issued a call for inclusiveness from the podium Friday. "Whatever our race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity; whether we are immigrants or native-born; whether we live with disabilities or do not; in wealth or in poverty; we are all exceptional in our commonly held yet fierce devotion to our country," Schumer had said. His remarks highlighted Democratic concerns about Trump's hard-line immigration policies, his mocking of a disabled journalist and more -- and were met with boos from some members of the crowd. "That speech, given with any other president, with any other audience, would have been cheered. It's not controversial language to say we're all Americans. It's not controversial language to reach out to others who might not be exactly like you," Schumer said Sunday. "And so, the fact that people didn't like it speaks poorly of them, not of what I said in the speech." Schumer said Trump ought to redirect audience members who booed. "The President-elect ought to lead. When his followers do things like that, he ought to speak positively about being inclusive and being American. The speech should have been aimed at bringing people together, as Ronald Reagan's speech was, as Franklin Roosevelt's speech was, Democratic and Republican," Schumer said. "The President-elect ought to lead. When his followers do things like that, he ought to speak positively about being inclusive and being American. The speech should have been aimed at bringing people together, as Ronald Reagan's speech was, as Franklin Roosevelt's speech was, Democratic and Republican," Schumer said. ©Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Sunday he opposes eight or nine of President Donald Trump's Cabinet nominees -- and could also attempt to block his eventual Supreme Court nominee. "If the nominee is out of the mainstream, we will do our best to keep the seat open," Schumer, D-New York, told CNN's Jake Tapper on "State of the Union" of the Supreme Court vacancy that Trump will get a shot at filling after majority Republicans blocked former President Barack Obama's nominee for a year. "I'm hopeful that President Trump may nominate someone who is mainstream and could get bipartisan support," Schumer said. "But if they don't, yes, we will fight it tooth and nail, as long as we have to." Schumer also said he'll oppose eight or nine of Trump's Cabinet nominees, and potentially more. He specifically said he opposes Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, Trump's pick for attorney general, and Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, Trump's nominee to helm the Environmental Protection Agency. "We certainly feel that we have to bring to the American people how different this Cabinet is -- how hard-right, how many conflicts of interest, billionaires," Schumer said. His comments come the same day Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham announced they will vote to confirm Trump's pick for secretary of state, former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson. "Listen, this wasn't an easy call. But I also believe that when there's doubt the president, the incoming president, gets the benefit of the doubt, and that's the way I've treated every president that I've had the obligation to vote for or against as a member of the United States Senate," McCain said on ABC's "This Week." Graham tweeted shortly after: "I will vote to confirm Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State.' That decision could mean Democrats won't have the votes to stop Tillerson's nomination. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio has also been on the fence, but Democrats would likely have needed all three -- McCain, Graham and Rubio -- to block Tillerson's confirmation. Democrats alone do not have enough votes to sink any of Trump's nominees, and Schumer noted it will be up to Republican opposition to actually block picks. Schumer also said he's worried Trump is "using populist rhetoric to cover up a hard-right agenda." He criticized Trump's actions over his first 36 hours as president, complaining to the CIA of media coverage of the size of his inauguration crowd. "President Trump is now president. He's not campaigning anymore," Schumer said. "And instead of talking about how many people showed up at his inauguration, he ought to talk about how many people he's going to bring into the middle class." "President Trump is now president.

The 5 p.m. reception for Hill leaders is also expected to touch on Trump's legislative agenda. Key issues include an array of big-ticket items from the repeal and replace of the Affordable Care Act to tax reform and a sizable infrastructure bill. The proposals must pass through Congress, making his relationships with lawmakers in both parties exceedingly important in the weeks and months ahead. Trump will then meet separately at 6 p.m. with House Speaker Paul Ryan, according to the White House schedule issued Sunday night. The Wisconsin Republican is considered key to the President's chances of enacting his proposals in Congress. Trump has also been pressing for Congress to confirm his Cabinet nominees. Only two nominees have been confirmed so far with a third, Rep. Mike Pompeo, Trump's pick to lead the CIA, expected to be confirmed on Monday. Senate Republicans and Democrats have engaged in a public fight in recent days over the speed of the eventual confirmation votes. Republicans have argued Democrats are slow-walking the nominees and have fallen far short of the pace from confirmations of previous administrations. Democrats have countered that Trump's picks have been slow to disclose their financial and ethics paperwork and, given the extensive private business ties of many, are being pushed through without proper vetting.

"You're going to see at the highest level of the past administration, at that level, I think, Donald Trump had a lot of problems with, and I don't blame him for having a lot of problems -- there were a lot of leaks," Nunes told CNN's Jake Tapper on "State of the Union." Nunes said leaks in the last 60 to 90 days before the election occurred were attributable to "the Obama administration directly or the intelligence community." Obama's director of national intelligence, James Clapper, issued a statement saying: "I do not believe the leaks came from within the (intelligence community)." Nunes comments were made after former CIA Director John Brennan criticized Trump's Saturday speech at the CIA. Trump has previously complained about intelligence community leaks, including information about what US intelligence officials briefed both Trump and former President Barack Obama about prior to Trump's inauguration. "We don't know where the leaks came from," Nunes said. Tapper replied: "Well, I broke the story, and I can tell you, John Brennan had nothing to do with it." "Well, but there were a lot of leaks that came ... it goes back for 90 days," Nunes said. Nunes said Trump's visit Saturday to the CIA was intended to "show support" for the agency. "Donald Trump is a citizen-politician," Nunes said. "He's really enjoying what he's doing. He's going to take the media on every single day. He's never been in politics. And I think you're going to see more of this." "Donald Trump is a citizen-politician," Nunes said. "He's really enjoying what he's doing. He's going to take the media on every single day.

Roughly 24 hours later, though, Trump's speech before the swearing in of his senior staff was more measured and strikingly less combative. To be sure, there were plenty of Trump hallmarks in the Sunday speech: The President needled the media by holding up a letter Obama wrote him and pledging not to tell the press what was in it. But the remarks stood in stark contrast to what the President said at the CIA a day earlier. "As I said during my inaugural address, this is not about party, this is not about ideology, this is about country, our country," Trump said, reading from notes. "And it is about serving the American people." Trump added that he and his senior aides will "face many challenges but with the faith in each other and the faith in God we will get the job done." Trump did not relitigate any of his campaign against Hillary Clinton -- something he is wont to do -- or complain about how the media covered his inauguration. Instead, Trump announced that he had talked to Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal about the deadly tornadoes that have killed nearly a dozen people. He also said he was scheduled to talk about the weather emergency with Florida Gov. Rick Scott. "They all got hit hard," Trump said of the tornadoes. "Looks like Georgia's lost at least 11 people as of this moment, a lot of people. So on behalf of all of us, Gov. Deal, condolences." The President also announced that he was scheduled to meet with the leaders of Canada and Mexico soon, where he planned to begin the process for renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement, beginning concrete work on one of his key campaign promises. Trump's unpredictability was, in itself, a trademark of his presidential campaign.

It's all part of the Inside Politics forecast. President Trump understands a key metric in real estate value -- location. It is true in Manhattan -- a corner condo on a high floor is going to cost more than a basement unit near the elevator. And it is certainly true in the White House. Even a tiny spot next to the Oval Office is more coveted than a larger space upstairs in the West Wing. CNN's Jeff Zeleny took us through the competition in the new Trump power structure, including presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner's move into a tiny space that offers the closest proximity to the President. "Reince Priebus, the chief of staff, I'm told will have the chief of staff's office, which has a fireplace as we all know, long conference table, access to outside," revealed Zeleny. "I'm told that Jared Kushner will be sitting in a smaller office, but the one that is closest to the Oval Office." Gen. Michael Hayden has a long track record in public service, including a stint as director of the Central Intelligence Agency, and has been a frequent critic of President Trump during his running battle with America's spy agencies and his campaign season affinity for Vladimir Putin. But he is a Trump ally in one important fight -- the effort to get Kansas Republican Rep Mike Pompeo confirmed as the next CIA chief. Mary Katharine Ham of The Federalist detailed General Hayden's cases for swift confirmation. "(Hayden) said (Pompeo) is going to follow the law and come to Congress if he thinks there should be a change," says Ham. "It's interesting because there's been so much fire between the CIA and Trump that on the other side, a respected veteran is coming out and saying, "Look, let's get this moving. the national security operation is important." The Trump White House did not appreciate it when the National Park Service Twitter account retweeted a New York Times comparison noting that President Obama has a bigger crowd for his 2009 Inaugural than President Trump had for his on Friday. So word went put for the agency to stand down -- and stop tweeting. Not likely to be a significant moment when we look back in 100 days and assess the administration's start. But Peter Baker of The New York Times called it an episode worth watching as we see how strong a hand the new White House will try to take over the minute-to-minute actions of far flung government agencies. "My colleague from the New York Times tweeted out on Friday pictures we've all been looking at of the different inaugurations. It was then retweeted by the National Park Service, which is normally in charge of that patch of ground and they got in trouble for that," reports Baker. "The Trump people didn't like that and the National Park Service went offline. It's a really interesting period; agencies in the government, which are probably pretty suspicious of this new president, to watch them deal with a new president who is pretty suspicious of them." As prospective Trump Cabinet members get their hearings on Capitol Hill, there is a scramble to find key deputies across the sprawling federal bureaucracy. There are worries in GOP circles that team Trump is running behind in making these choices -- and stories across Washington that one issue is getting people to say yes. Top Trump aides say not to worry, and promise a steady stream of announcements in the days ahead. But the Treasury Department is one example. Steven Mnuchin is the Wall Street veteran tapped to lead the department. CNN is told he wants a veteran Washington hand as his top deputy, but was unsuccessful in his first foray. GOP sources say the Trump transition team identified Texas Rep. Jeb Hensarling as a good fit. But word is Hensarling -- who was considered but not chosen for the top Treasury job -- said he wasn't interested. Barack Obama is now a former president and private citizen but promises to step into some political battles if he deems it right or necessary. A big question in Washington is whether his list includes the race to lead the Democratic National Committee. We know Obama's favorite in the race is Tom Perez, who was most recently Obama's labor secretary. But will the former president work the phones and twist arms to help Perez round up votes? CNN's Nia-Malika Henderson explored the dynamics. "His guy, Tom Perez, the former labor secretary, is running as well as Michael Blake who is running as the vice chair; he is an Obama staffer. [Obama] has said very complimentary things about both," explains Henderson. "Michael Blake is actually using some of Obama's former fundraisers in Chicago to fund his race. it will be interesting to see if he officially endorses and if it matters."

"You're saying it's a falsehood. And they're giving -- Sean Spicer, our press secretary -- gave alternative facts," she said. Todd responded: "Alternative facts aren't facts, they are falsehoods." Conway then tried to pivot to policy points. But later in the interview, Todd pressed Conway again on why the White House sent Spicer out to make false claims about crowd size, asking: "What was the motive to have this ridiculous litigation of crowd size?" "Your job is not to call things ridiculous that are said by our press secretary and our president. That's not your job," Conway said. Todd followed up: "Can you please answer the question? Why did he do this? You have not answered it -- it's only one question." Conway said: "I'll answer it this way: Think about what you just said to your viewers. That's why we feel compelled to go out and clear the air and put alternative facts out there." Trump himself directed Spicer to go to the White House briefing room to talk about the inauguration crowd size, Conway told CNN's Athena Jones on Sunday. A source told CNN that Trump was enraged about photographic comparisons of the two inaugurations. Trump publicly complained about media coverage of the size of his inauguration crowd during a visit to CIA headquarters Saturday.

In an interview on ABC's "This Week," Conway was pressed on whether the White House will respond to more than 200,000 petition signatures calling on Trump to release his tax returns. "The White House response is that he's not going to release his tax returns," Conway said. "We litigated this all through the election. People didn't care," she said. "They voted for him, and let me make this very clear: Most Americans are very focused on what their tax returns will look like while President Trump is in office, not what his look like. And you know full well that President Trump and his family are complying with all the ethical rules, everything they need to do to step away from his businesses and be a full-time president." During his presidential campaign, Trump became the first major party nominee since 1972 not to release his tax returns -- citing ongoing IRS audits, saying he would do so once those audits were completed. Conway sought to clarify her comments Sunday night, asserting there had been no change in position from the campaign. "Our position from the campaign has not changed," Conway said. "He is under audit and has been advised by accountants and lawyers not to release." She did not say whether he would release them at conclusion of the audit. Trump repeated the claim that the audit is responsible for his delay in releasing his tax returns at a news conference less than two weeks from his inauguration. "I'm not releasing the tax returns because, as you know, they're under audit," Trump said then. He also claimed that the public isn't interested in his tax returns. "You know, the only one that cares about my tax returns are the reporters, OK? They're the only ones," he said. Trump's comments are directly contradicted by most major public polls on the issue.

John McCain and Lindsey Graham announced Sunday they will vote for President Donald Trump's pick for secretary of state, former ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, likely paving the way for his confirmation. The two, along with Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, had up to now withheld their support. "Listen, this wasn't an easy call. But I also believe that when there's doubt, the President, the incoming President, gets the benefit of the doubt, and that's the way I've treated every president that I've had the obligation to vote for or against as a member of the United States Senate," McCain said on ABC's "This Week." Graham tweeted shortly after: "I will vote to confirm Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State." On CBS' "Face the Nation," Graham said the same. "After careful consideration, and much discussion with Mr. Tillerson, we have decided to support his nomination to be secretary of state. Though we still have concerns about his past dealings with the Russian government and President Vladimir Putin, we believe that Mr. Tillerson can be an effective advocate for US interests," McCain and Graham said in a joint statement released Sunday. Their decision likely means Democrats won't have the votes to stop Tillerson's nomination. Senate Democrats, who number 48, would likely have needed all three -- McCain, Graham and Rubio -- to block Tillerson's confirmation.

But the new administration is also driving policy changes that will have far more long-term significance. Here's a list of the Trump administration's actions in its first 72 hours: ©The moment Donald Trump became the 45th President, some legal experts say he triggered a violation of the foreign emoluments clause in the Constitution, flouted the plain terms of the lease for his Washington hotel, and opened himself up to a dizzying array of ethical questions on financial conflicts of interests. For months, a vocal group of constitutional lawyers, ethics law scholars and Democrats on Capitol Hill have urged Trump to avoid the legal perplexities posed by his vast business enterprises and divest his assets into a truly blind trust (or the equivalent). His response? "The law is totally on my side, meaning, the President can't have a conflict of interest," "I have have a no conflict situation because I'm President ... it's a nice thing to have," he repeated to reporters at a news conference earlier this month. Trump instead pledged to resign from management of the Trump Organization, but according to an Of all the potential legal problems posed by Trump's financial holdings, none is more immediate and complicated than the hotel he opened in the Old Post Office in DC. The Trump Organization leased the property from the federal General Services Administration in 2013, but a clause in the lease states that no "elected official of the government ... shall be admitted to any share or part of this Lease, or to any benefit that may arise therefrom." As of Saturday night, the GSA has not declared the Trump Organization in breach of the contract, and declined to comment on the status of any negotiations to resolve the apparent breach. The Trump Organization and the White House also did not respond to requests for comment. But at least one liberal group was quick to file "Elected government officials are barred from receiving any benefit under the lease, and now that Mr. Trump has been sworn in today as President of the United States, Trump Old Post Office LLC, a company he largely owns, is in violation of the lease's conflicts-of-interest provision," wrote the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington in a letter to the GSA. "This is bad as it gets," said Norm Eisen, who served as a chief White House ethics lawyer in the Obama administration. The hotel's Twitter account, on the other hand, exclaimed Friday: "We are waiting for you Mr. President! Thank you!" Assume for a moment that the GSA does not move to terminate the lease (at least not right away), and Trump retains his interest in the hotel -- experts say he still has a more profound constitutional problem on his hands under the foreign emoluments clause starting on Day 1 in Oval Office. The main complaint here is that when a foreign official stays at the Trump hotel, they will be giving him an emolument -- i.e., money -- violating Article I, Section 9, Clause 8 of the Constitution, which states that "no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under (the United States), shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State." Trump's lawyers said in a But an outspoken group of ethics lawyers say allowing foreign diplomats to curry favor with Trump by using his hotels would defeat the entire purpose of the emoluments clause. Eisen has teamed up with former White House ethics lawyer Richard Painter under President George W. Bush, along with Harvard Law School professor Laurence H. Tribe, to argue that the emoluments clause "covers even ordinary, fair market value transactions that result in any economic profit or benefit" to the President. In other words: "Trump can't receive any direct payment of any kind from a foreign government, including a fee for services," agrees So yes, those Given all of these weighty legal issues facing Trump's presidency, the natural question for many is: Who has standing to enforce a Constitutional violation? The short answer is Congress. "Congress would be well within its rights to impeach him for engaging in 'high crimes and misdemeanors'," according to Eisen, Painter and Tribe if there was reason to believe Trump violated the emoluments clause. Congress could also create a brand new cause of action allowing private parties -- think business competitors -- to file suit. But given that both the House and Senate remain under Republican control, the likelihood of action on either front is unlikely at best. At the end of the day, many experts say it might simply be left up to the voters if the President and Congress do not adequately address these issues. "How the public reacts may depend on whether it appears the conflicts are affecting decisions," Noble said. "This is why we expect the president to follow certain norms and not try to push the legal envelope on ethics rules."

A central promise of Trump's campaign was that he would revamp the 23-year-old trade pact. At a White House event Sunday, Trump said he had scheduled meetings with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Pexc3xb1a Nieto. The White House says the meeting with Nieto is set for Jan. 31. "We're going to start some negotiations having to do with NAFTA," Trump said. "Anybody ever hear of NAFTA?" he said. "I ran a campaign somewhat based on NAFTA. But we're going to start renegotiating on NAFTA, on immigration, on security at the border." Convincing Canada and Mexico to renegotiate NAFTA -- or convincing Congress, where majority Republicans have long supported free trade, not to try to block him from withdrawing from the deal -- could be tough tasks. Former President Barack Obama was critical of NAFTA as a candidate, too. His effort to renegotiate the deal came in the form of the 12-nation Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have imposed Democratic-favored labor and environmental rules on the countries included in the deal, including Canada and Mexico. But Trump was sharply critical of the Trans-Pacific Partnership as a candidate, saying he will kill the deal -- which is well within his power, since it has not yet been enacted. Trump has also pledged to get Mexico to pay for a wall along the United States' southern border -- potentially, he has said, through tariffs. Imposing those border taxes now would violate NAFTA. Any move to change the terms of NAFTA or withdraw from the deal also runs the risk of being met with retaliatory tariff hikes in other countries -- meaning the cost of goods shipped to the United States could become higher for American consumers, and US companies could lose access to key foreign markets.

The White House confirmed President Donald Trump invited Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Washington in early February in a phone call between the two leaders Sunday. A senior administration official said that moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv remains a priority for the president but cautioned that it would not be happen quickly. No announcements are expected Monday or in the coming days, the official said, adding that working on the issue will be one of the first tasks awaiting Jared Kushner, a senior adviser and son-in-law to Trump. The mayor of Jerusalem, Nir Barkat, told Israeli Army Radio on Monday that he is in contact with the White House about moving the embassy to Jerusalem. "I do know, from the talks I've been holding with members of the American administration, that they are serious about their intention," Barkat said. "They have several assets in Jerusalem that could provide a solution. I definitely think that you don't move an embassy in a day." Arab and European diplomats said there have been signs Trump and his advisers could slow down implementing a formal relocation amid warnings from Arab and European officials to the incoming administration that the move could unleash violence, undermine the peace process, damage US standing in the Middle East, and endanger American personnel. They have urged the incoming administration to consult with allies about the move and put it in the context of a broader strategy toward addressing the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. White House press secretary Sean Spicer stressed Sunday the administration was in the beginning stages of discussions regarding Trump's campaign pledge to move the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Spicer, asked whether a move will be announced soon, told reporters: "We are at the very beginning stages of even discussing this subject." Last week Spicer said "there would be a further announcement" on moving the embassy, saying "the president has made clear that Israel has not gotten the respect it deserves." Yet the subject of the embassy move, which would represent a major change in US policy, was not the focus of the call Sunday between Trump and Netanyahu, administration and Israeli officials said. Statements from both governments about the call did not even mention the issue, saying the two leaders spoke about Iran, Syria and peace between Israelis and Palestinians. In a statement after the phone call, the White House said Trump "affirmed his unprecedented commitment to Israel's security" and said he invited Netanyahu to an early February meeting at the White House. "The President emphasized that peace between Israel and the Palestinians can only be negotiated directly between the two parties, and that the United States will work closely with Israel to make progress towards that goal. The President invited Prime Minister Netanyahu to an early February meeting at the White House," the statement said. While Israel has long wanted the US to move the embassy and has welcomed Trump's pledge, top Israeli officials have said the issue is not the most important in the relationship, stressing the threat posed by Iran, the violence in Syria and the need for Israel to improve its relations with Arab states remained the government's top priorities. Netanyahu's office said the two leaders had a "very warm conversation" and pledged to "work closely with President Trump to forge a common vision to advance peace and security in the region, with no daylight between the United States and Israel." Shortly after a White House staff swearing-in ceremony, Trump told a pool reporter he had a "very nice" call with Netanyahu. He ignored a shouted question about moving the embassy. On Thursday, Trump assured Israel that he is committed to making good on his campaign pledge to move the embassy, telling the newspaper Israel Hayom, "of course I remember what I told you about Jerusalem ... and you know I'm not a person who breaks promises." With scant discussion with the incoming administration about its actual plans for the embassy, Netanyahu convened his national security team and ordered Israeli security services to prepare for possible scenarios of worsening violence if the Trump administration made an early announcement upon taking office. The meeting came amid Palestinian efforts to head off an embassy move, writing world leaders and increasing media outreach. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas met Jordanian King Abdullah II in Amman on Sunday to coordinate moves against the possible relocation of the embassy. In the weeks leading up to his inauguration, Trump's advisers had floated the possibility of initially having the US ambassador to Israel work and live in the US consulate in Jerusalem, while the American Embassy remains in Tel Aviv. Diplomatic sources said such a plan could be a compromise -- that allows Trump to move on fulfilling his pledge on Jerusalem -- which Israel and the Palestinians both claim as their capital -- without starting his term with a firestorm a formal relocation of the embassy from Tel Aviv would almost certainly bring. Trump has named New York lawyer David Friedman as his ambassador to Israel, pending Senate confirmation. Among the options being considered are for Friedman to begin work Jerusalem, either from a hotel suite or a designated office in the US consulate. Friedman, who already maintains a home in Jerusalem, has long been a proponent of moving the US Embassy to Jerusalem and, upon being named, said he looked forward to working "from the US Embassy in Israel's eternal capital, Jerusalem." The 1995 Jerusalem Embassy Act calls on the US to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and relocate the embassy there. But the law allows for the move to be waived if the President deems it harmful to US national security interests. Since it passed, every US president -- Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama -- has signed the waiver every six months, even though Bush and Clinton had promised to move the embassy during their presidential campaigns. Earlier this month, Obama renewed a presidential waiver delaying the move for another six months, citing "national security interests." The waiver expires June 1. Israeli sources have suggested the May 24 Israeli holiday of "Jerusalem Day" as a possible date for a more official move toward relocation. That national holiday commemorates the reunification of Jerusalem and the establishment of Israeli control over the Old City following the June 1967 Six Day War and typically is marked by ceremonies and memorial services. Diplomats suggested that once the administration is in office for a few months, the threat of more chaos in the Middle East and the need not to alienate US Arab allies may cause a newly-minted President Trump to sing a different tune. ©Beyond the empty seats filled a day earlier by President Donald Trump's VIPs, far past the stage where celebrities and activists headlining Saturday's Women's March took turns delivering campaign-style speeches, a smaller gathering of protesters blocks from Pennsylvania Avenue quietly strained for a view of the White House's South Portico. The mass demonstrations that consumed Washington on Trump's first full day in office were a defiant and at times wide-eyed display -- an implicit rebuke to the portrait of "American carnage" that colored But they also arrived as tourists -- and gazed on the capital's formidable architecture with a mix of anger and awe. For many, the march represented a first foray into pavement politics. Enraged by the new president's remarks about women on the campaign trail -- and his bragging, caught in a 2005 video, that he "grabs" women "by the pussy" -- they lashed out against the administration with the passion of converts. "This is actually my first protest," Braydee Euliss, who drove to Washington from Muncie, Indiana, told CNN. "I'm here now because I not only stand to lose personally, but women collectively and women of color especially, stand to lose, too." Brittney Nesby, an Ohio native living in Washington, said Trump's comments on the now infamous "Access Hollywood" tape had stuck with her. "He threatened to grab me by the pussy," Nesby said. "We came so far and look" -- she stopped, gesturing to the crush of people around her -- "this is the melting pot of America. You see all types of women out here fighting for their rights. That's my message." Others carried theirs on pins, shirts and DIY posters. A teenage girl on the mall used crayons to sketch what would, over the course of hours, become a familiar message: "Pussy grabs back." Thousands wore silk screened tees proudly declaring themselves "Nasty Women" -- a reference to As noon passed, still less than 24 hours since Trump assumed office, word began to spread that organizers had given up on keeping a coherent march route. Overflow crowds had flooded the surrounding streets and marchers stepped over low chain link barriers to decamp under the shadow of the Washington Monument. Streaming out of Union Station, the late comers -- their trains delayed by the volume of passenger traffic -- were greeted by a busking trombonist who played an American jazz gospel, "When the Saints Go Marching In." They celebrated each other, shocked and marveling at the massive turnout and the dirty, wicked puns that colored the festivities. They asked reporters and each other about the latest crowd counts. Organizers told CNN last week they expected no fewer 250,000, but thought the number could push higher if the weather cooperated. It did. Rep. Maxine Waters, a California Democrat, walked west on F Street to join protesters near the White House. "The crowd itself is the message," she said, as smaller gathering amassed at her side, chanting her name. "Wherever (Trump) is, he's looking at this, he's witnessing this and he's got to know that something is being said here today about him, that he'd better know that he can't get away with doing some of the things that he said he's going to do." Back on the lawn facing the South Lawn of the White House, Michelle Sheahan waved a poster in the direction of the Oval Office. She propped it up on a fence, for convenient viewing, and turned back to crowd. "Women deserve equal rights, equal pay. We are half of the population and my great grandmother didn't have the same benefits that I have and previous generations have fought for the rights that we have today," she said. "We can't go backwards. I refuse to go backwards - that won't happen." "We can't go backwards. I refuse to go backwards - that won't happen." ©Robert Cameron pushes through a thick wall of Carrizo cane and in a few seconds the Rio Grande and Mexico suddenly appear. If you've never experienced standing at the country's edge, it can be a surreal moment to so easily walk to the riverbank and stare across to the other side. This is one of those places where there are no Border Patrol agents in sight and no customs checkpoints for miles. You feel alone. But then you notice a well-worn path coming out of the river where the tall bamboo-like cane has been flattened, and reality strikes: You're not the first person to come through here. In fact, that's why Cameron has brought us here. Cameron, 39, operates Texas Border Tours and runs a small fleet of all-terrain vehicles that take tourists on a rugged, off-road chance to see the Texas-Mexico border up close. A few months ago, Cameron recorded video of a group of men swimming across the Rio Grande with large packs in this very spot. He can't say definitively that the men were smuggling drugs into the United States, but he's says he's seen enough to know that that's probably what was happening. The Rio Grande Valley in South Texas is one of the country's busiest drug smuggling and crossing points for undocumented immigrants. In 2016, more than 186,000 migrants were captured by Border Patrol agents who also seized more than 326,000 pounds of marijuana. "There is a problem, and anything to throw at it to fix the problem is good and people want a solution," Cameron told CNN. Cameron voted for Donald Trump and fully supports the President's "He tells it like it is," Cameron said as he cruised past several miles of already existing border fence near the town of Progreso, Texas. "He doesn't sugarcoat it. He is going to get it done." But Cameron says this even as he questions if a solid concrete wall will actually work. He's seen what happened the last time the United States tried to build a wall, and that's what he's showing us now. President George W. Bush signed the Secure Fence Act into law in 2006. To build the wall the federal government filed dozens of eminent domain lawsuits against private landowners to gain access for the wall's construction. The result was a border fence that roughly followed the general path of the Rio Grande but created a no-man's land between the fence and the river. It also left gaping holes in the wall so that the landowners could access their land south of the wall. Cameron's ATV cruises past several miles of border fence, kicking up a trail of dust. It doesn't take long to find a number of large openings in the fence. "This is definitely not secure," Cameron said. "I don't know how that impenetrable wall is going to be built. People need access to their land." On the surface, Cameron might not seem like a typical Trump supporter. He and his parents were born in Mexico. He was 8 years old when his family moved legally to the United States in 1985. Cameron became a US citizen 13 years later. Criss-crossing the border to visit family and friends is still part of his weekly routine. He thinks politicians and the news media have painted a distorted picture of what life is really like here. "It's not as bad as people make it seem to be," Cameron told CNN as he led a Rio Grande tour near the town of Progreso, Texas. He also knows that although the rest of the country sees border issues as black and white, life here is more cloudy and nuanced. "I do have relatives and friends who are here illegally," Cameron said. He doesn't want to see them rounded up and deported. "Comprehensive immigration reform definitely would be good. Something will allow people to come and do it the right way." The idea of American citizens caught in a no-man's land between is something 88-year-old Pamela Taylor can only laugh about. She's one of those Brownsville, Texas, residents that lives in what she likes to call a "gated community." Taylor was born in England and married a soldier from South Texas just after World War II ended. In 1946, the couple moved to the house she still lives in today, just a football field's length from Mexico. For decades, she's watched undocumented migrants emerge from the Rio Grande and quickly scatter through her neighborhood in hopes of eluding Border Patrol agents. Every night she leaves bottles of water for the migrants and the agents engaged in this never-ending cat-and-mouse game. "You have to be Christian about it. You know it's not good to see people starve," Taylor told CNN. Taylor has become a bit of a border celebrity. She's opinionated, charming and quick with stories that surprise. Like the time she says she found a "40-kilo" stash of marijuana under some bushes in her yard and the day she found an undocumented migrant sitting in her living room. "He had come in and used the bathroom facilities, shaved, cleaned up and everything and he was in the rocking chair watching the Border Patrol go by," Taylor calmly recounted. At the edge of the long drive way leading to her home, there's a large sign that reads "We're part of America. We need representation and protection. NOT A FENCE." Despite that, Taylor supported Trump and wants to see the country crack down on illegal immigration. But she finds the idea of a wall rather ridiculous. The current border wall has surrounded her home for almost 10 years and she says nothing has changed. "How did they get through that wall? It's been here since '07," Taylor said. "That wall is not going to stop them." As Trump takes office the Rio Grande Valley is bracing for the next chapter. As the sun set on Taylor's home she shared a sentiment you often hear from the people who live here. "I would like for Mr. Trump -- I would even feed him -- if he will come down here and talk to the people. He is doing exactly what the government did to us in the beginning. He's not asking how it's going to affect the people that live here." Spend any length of time along the United States' southern border and you'll hear a familiar story. It's usually about the days when crossing this international border was as easy as walking to the curb to check your mailbox. The Texas-Mexico border is a mixture of several urban locations like Brownsville, Laredo and El Paso but most of it is hundreds of miles of vast, wide-open spaces. "People here have friends on both sides of the border," said Marcos Paredes. "I see some communities that have been really closely linked forever." Paredes, 60, is a former Big Bend National Park Ranger and now pilots scenic airplane tours over this majestic West Texas landscape. He's lived in the far-flung border outpost of Terlingua for 40 years. If Trump and Congress follow through with his campaign promise of building a wall along the entire length of the US southern border there are serious questions and doubts -- even among Trump's supporters -- of how that would be done in this terrain of West Texas. Paredes thinks the best way to make people understand what a waste of time and money it would be is by taking to the skies. In a single-engine Cessna, Paredes takes us on an aerial tour over some of the most stunning landscape you'll ever see. It's a geologic paradise as breathtaking rock formations rise in the distance. Below our plane, dramatic canyons and cliffs carve through the beige and rusty-orange colored limestone. For hundreds and hundreds of miles there are few signs of life. "I have taken many folks up and this notion of a wall is something they supported," Paredes told CNN as he piloted his plane over Terlingua Creek. "And then they flew over this country and realized, 'How are they going to do it?' It can't be done." In Paredes' eyes the notion of a wall is "divisive." He argues that a stronger relationship with Mexico would be more effective. If you want to reach this hidden Mexican border town it takes a little work. All you have to do is take a two-hour drive deep into Big Bend National Park, follow a scenic footpath to the edge of the Rio Grande and wave across the water to Adrian. He'll probably be waiting on the other side with a flat-bottom boat and he'll paddle over to pick you up for a few dollars. Then you can climb on a donkey for the mile-long ride to reach Boquillas. For the lucky tourists who make the journey, it's worth the trouble to get a taste of the tamales at Jose Falcon's Restaurant, run by his daughter Lilia. "It's a very good life here," Lilia Falcon told CNN. "Everybody takes care of the tourists over here because we live from the tourists. That's all there is." On the Mexican side of the border, the closest town to Boquillas is 160 miles away. The town has about 200 residents. Boquillas captures the deep connection of the borderlands. Until September 11, 2001, you could basically cross the river freely here. Neither the US government nor the Mexican government seemed to pay much attention. That all changed after 9/11. The border crossing was shut down and Falcon's restaurant went out of business. "It was really hard," Lilia Falcon said. Many townspeople moved away. But in 2013, the United States re-established the Boquillas Port of Entry. Now the restaurant is back in business and the town is growing again. Electricity was non-existent until a few years ago, when a solar farm was built on the edge of town. "The word is spreading out more that it's very safe to come here," Lilia Falcon said. The times have changed, and traveling to and from Boquillas now requires a passport. The US customs checkpoint is inside a ranger station in Big Bend National Park. But Lilia Falcon worries about the future and what Trump's immigration and border security plans might mean for the future of this little village. She can't help but wonder if, in the name of national security, this official border crossing could be closed again. "Then the town will be dead again," said Lilia Falcon. "It would be hard." "Then the town will be dead again," said Lilia Falcon. "It would be hard." ©The Centers for Disease Control postponed a summit scheduled for next month on climate change and public health ahead of President Donald Trump's inauguration, participants and the CDC confirmed Monday. While the Trump administration did not explicitly ask for the move, one of the scheduled keynote speakers of the Climate and Health Summit believes the move was made with the new President's position on climate change in mind. Trump has famously called climate change a "hoax," though his Cabinet has attempted to strike a more moderate tone in confirmation hearings. The CDC started to notify participants just before Christmas that the meeting was "postponed," according to CDC spokeswoman Bernadette Burden. "We are exploring options to reschedule the meeting while considering budget priorities for fiscal year 2017, including the current continuing resolution, and potential overlap with an APHA conference on the same topic also being held later in 2017," Burden said in a statement. The meeting postponement was first The American Public Health Association is planning a fall meeting, said Executive Director George Benjamin, but the February conference had been intended as a kickoff to a year of climate and health-related events. Benjamin was supposed to deliver one of the opening keynotes at the conference next month. While the Trump administration did not directly cancel this conference, Benjamin said, it bears the hallmark of his influence. "They ran this up the flagpole a few weeks before the Inauguration," Benjamin said of the conference organizers. "They were afraid that the Trump administration would cancel it and it would create all kinds of political headaches for them." Benjamin said the CDC has in the past gotten political heat for positions on sensitive issues like a gun initiative in recent years. "They're pretty gun-shy -- pun intended -- over these types of issues," he said. Climate scientists have been concerned about what the Trump administration might do on environmental policy since his election. Some have been creating their own archives of government climate data for fear of it possibly disappearing from agency websites, and others were alarmed when a new Trump administration White House website did not immediately have a page for climate change like the Obama administration did. Trump's team is still populating his new website, which was created fresh after the Obama site was archived. One of Trump's first executive actions was halting any non-finalized Obama administration regulation -- a common action for an incoming president of a different party than his predecessor -- which halts some environmental rules. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Benjamin characterized himself and APHA as "disappointed," but said he hopes the interested groups will find a way to hold another conference later in the year -- with or without the new administration. "I'm very much concerned about the precedent and very concerned about how (the Trump administration will) handle climate change going forward," Benjamin said. "The truth of the matter is we can pretend like climate change is not here, but ... it's a big issue. So we can put a name to it and try to fix it, or we can not put a name to it, but we're going to have to fix it anyway," he added. "But we thinking putting a name to and trying to fix it is a more intellectually honest way to do it." Trump's environmental nominees have raised the ire of environmental groups in confirmation hearings, but most have refrained from voicing full-throated skepticism before senators as some have in the past. None have called climate change a "hoax." Instead, all said that the climate is changing and man has a role, but they say there is still debate on how much of a factor human action is and on how to stop it -- a position contrary to the strong consensus among scientists that climate change is man-made and drastic action is needed to prevent a series of harmful effects including rising sea levels and extreme weather.

Chris Collins, R-New York, responded to accusations of inappropriate financial investments regarding Department of Health and Human Services pick Rep. Tom Price on Monday, saying that nothing the two representatives did was insider trading. Price was grilled last week during his confirmation hearings on whether he purchased stocks in a company called Innate Immunotherapeutics after receiving a "stock tip" from Collins, a fellow member of the House. "There was nothing done that was insider trading or unethical," Collins told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on "The Situation Room," adding that he talks about his involvement with the company that Price bought stocks in because he's the biggest shareholder. "I talk about it all the time, just as you would talk about your children," he added. "Certainly many of the people I've talked about it (to), and he was one of the few ... he decided on his own to make an investment." During the hearing last week, Price also denied that what they did was inappropriate. "Do you believe it is appropriate for a senior member of Congress, actively involved in policy-making in the health center, to repeatedly personally invest in a drug company that could benefit from those actions?" Sen. Patty Murray, D-Washington, asked. "That's not what happened," said Price, who insisted repeatedly that he never received information that could be considered stock tip. Blitzer grilled Collins about his involvement, and Collins defended it as all done appropriately. "I never said to buy it or it's a great stock," he said. "I talked to them about the great work this company is doing." "I never said to buy it or it's a great stock," he said. "I talked to them about the great work this company is doing." ©Former CIA Director Leon Panetta said Monday it was inappropriate for President Donald Trump to use his speech to the agency as an opportunity to complain about reports on the crowd size at his inauguration. "I just got the impression when he was speaking there, that somehow, he forgot that he was President of the United States and was speaking to the intelligence officers that spend their lives trying to serve this country. That was not the appropriate place to start whining about what was happening in terms of numbers in the inauguration," Panetta told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on " Trump had "That wall contains the stars of CIA officers who have given their life to this country. That's about as close as you can get to hallow ground at the CIA. It's the equivalent of speaking at Arlington Cemetery," Panetta said. Trump had told the CIA: "There is nobody that feels stronger about the intelligence community and the CIA than Donald Trump, there is nobody." But he also spent time telling the hundreds of CIA employees that the media were among "the most dishonest human beings on Earth" and claimed news reports lied about the size of his inauguration crowd. "To go off and start talking about the press, talking about how many people were at the inauguration, I just think frankly, that was not appropriate. I just think the President needs to understand, he's President now. He's not just a candidate, he doesn't have to spend time embellishing himself or what he did, he's President of the United States," Panetta told The former CIA director said Trump may be having trouble getting out of campaign-mode, and transitioning to his new role.

Sens. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and Susan Collins of Maine unveiled a bill that they are describing as an "Obamacare replacement plan." The duo is promising that the proposal would give more power to the states on health care policy, increase access to affordable insurance and help cover millions of Americans who are currently uninsured. At the core of their proposal: Any state that likes Obamacare can keep it. "Republicans think that if you like your insurance, you should keep it. And we mean it," Cassidy said. "They could opt to stay in Obamacare or they could opt for no federal help. So, California and New York, you love Obamcare? You can keep it." It is not clear whether the legislation, which is based on a measure Collins and Cassidy introduced in 2015 and has a companion bill in the House from Rep. Pete Sessions, would garner backing from party leadership. But it is another sign that Republican lawmakers are increasingly feeling the heat to show how they would replace what they roll back the Affordable Care Act. Former President Barack Obama's signature health care law covers some 20 million people and emerged as one of the most politically divisive issues of his presidency. The fear is that taking action to repeal the law would create deep instability in the insurance markets and potentially result in millions of people's coverage being disrupted or taken away. Collins, a moderate Republican, has been particularly vocal in insisting that Republicans should not vote to repeal major parts of Obamacare until there is clarity on a replacement plan. She said Monday that it is imperative for Republicans lawmakers to ensure that patients don't experience "needless and avoidable gaps in coverage," and that the party must put forth legislation to replace Obamacare now. "We recognize that our bill is not perfect. It is still a work in progress. I expect that we will get many ideas from my colleagues for further refinements and we are completely open to that," Collins said. "But if we do not start putting specific legislation on the table that can be debated, refined, amended and enacted, then we will fail the American people." The Cassidy-Collins bill, the Louisiana Republican said, would allow states to implement the replacement plan of their choice by 2019: "By the time 2020 rolls around, everything's done," Cassidy said. Democrats are quickly objecting to the new proposal. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Monday afternoon that the Cassidy-Collins bill was "a far cry from the full replacement plan (Republicans) have promised for years." "Millions of Americans would be kicked off their plans, out-of-pocket costs and deductibles for consumers would skyrocket, employer-based coverage for working families would be disrupted, and protections for people with pre-existing conditions, such as cancer, would be gutted. All while the wealthiest few get a tax cut," Schumer said in a statement. "It is nearly impossible to keep the benefits of the Affordable Care Act without keeping the whole thing." Republicans in Congress have already begun the legislative process of overhauling the law. On Day One of the new Congress, Republican senators used a budget maneuver to start the repeal process, although a final repeal bill is not likely to land on President Donald Trump's desk for some weeks, even possibly months. And within hours of being sworn in as president, Collins called the executive order "very confusing" and difficult to interpret. "I think that the executive order is very confusing, we really don't know yet what the impact will be," she said. "I think that the executive order is very confusing, we really don't know yet what the impact will be," she said. ©First they marched. Now, Democratic organizers are telling the scores of women who turned out to oppose President Donald Trump over the weekend, it's time to run -- for something. The massive turnout in Washington and across the country at women's marches Saturday stunned even the most optimistic liberals -- injecting an energy into their cause that many accused the Hillary Clinton campaign of lacking. But it is also forcing Democrats to rapidly find ways to channel that energy into a sustained movement before the moment is lost. One way several groups are attempting to do that: recruit the women who participated Saturday to run for office -- from school boards and city councils to Congress. Emily's List, which helps train and fund female Democratic candidates who support abortion rights, hosted 500 women for a day-long training session Sunday -- with nearly 500 more on its waiting list. "I'm confident I talked to a future United States senator. I just may not know who it is yet," Stephanie Schriock, the president of Emily's List, said in an interview Monday. One of those candidates is Bella Stenvall, an 18-year-old from California who is interning on Capitol Hill for Rep. Salud Carbajal. She said she'd like to run for local office at home one day. Her mother moved to the United States from the Philippines at age 18, so "the opportunities I have in America were always stressed to me very strongly," she said -- one of the reasons she signed up for the Emily's List training. Trump's campaign rhetoric was infuriating, she said, and his victory was "a firm call to action." "All of a sudden, it's real," she said. "None of us saw this coming. It was genuine shock." The message of Sunday's training session, Schriock and Stenvall said, was that women who participated in Saturday's marches already have the most important quality they need to run for office. "We have to start by reminding each and every one of them that the most important thing is a commitment to make some change -- a true desire to help your community. That is the most important piece," Schriock said. "We so often hear from our women who are getting trained -- they'll list off things like, 'I don't have enough experience, I don't have that law degree, I don't have connections to really wealthy people.' What we do is say, none of that matters. That's actually nothing that you need," she said. Other organizations that help women run for office -- some nonpartisan -- are also reporting upticks. VoteRunLead has trained 5,000 women to run for office over a two-year period -- but 2,300 of those came in the two months since Trump's election. "Something switched," said the group's founder, Erin Vilardi. Similarly, the Center for American Women and Politics, which is part of Rutgers University's Eagleton Institute of Politics, saw increased enrollment in their seminars, according to the group's director, Debbie Walsh. The group holds an annual training program in March. Two years ago, four people had registered by January 1. Last year, there were two. However, this year, by New Year's Day, more than 100 had registered and paid in full. Walsh said the influx her group has seen wasn't an anomaly -- partner programs across the country have seen a similar trend. "People are seeing the consequences of elections and that they really matter and that's where we're seeing the upsurge in women," Walsh said. Stung by the depth of Democrats' problems that were laid bare after Clinton's loss, Democrats hope to use the anti-Trump energy to begin rebuilding the party's empty bench. A new group called "Run for Something" -- launched by Democratic operatives Amanda Litman and Ross Morales Rocketto, with a board made of veterans of the Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders campaigns -- is seeking to recruit and train progressives under 35 for races for city councils, state legislatures and more. In the group's first 72 hours, more than 400 people reached out, expressing interest, Litman said. Those include "a lot of people who haven't thought about public service before this particular moment; a lot of people who say, 'I'm frustrated and angry that my community and my politicians won't represent me anymore,' " she said. The mix of those expressing interests, she said, is split evenly between men and women, includes many African-Americans, members of the LGBT community, immigrants and "quite a few veterans." The group is looking for people who don't already have inroads into politics. It has a network of more than 200 Democratic operatives who have offered to help prospective candidates -- guiding them through launching candidacies, raising money and more. It's eyeing 2017 municipal races and contests for Virginia House of Delegates seats. "The reason why the focus on some of these down-ballot races is so critical is that these are the individuals whoa re going to be future congress people, future senators, future governors, future attorneys general," said Morales Rocketto. "These are the individuals who 10, 15, 20 years from now are going to be essentially running the country." Beyond potential candidates for office, Democratic groups say they are seeing a major influx of new donors and supporters. Emily's List said 60% of its donors in the week after the presidential election had never contributed before. The group has doubled the number of people who are online monthly donors since then. And 3,300 have reached out to express interest in running for office -- including 860 since Trump's inauguration Friday. The official Democratic infrastructure is benefiting, too. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee -- the campaign arm for the party's House candidates -- has already had its best-ever January for digital fundraising, and has seen its list of grassroots supporters grow by 500,000 people in 2017 so far. Now, the DCCC and other Democratic groups are rapidly hashing out strategies to channel the sudden energy toward the 2018 midterms -- not the 2020 presidential race. "We will focus on educating voters on the importance of the midterms, to get people to turn that emotion into electoral success as soon as possible," said DCCC spokeswoman Meredith Kelly. The seven candidates seeking to lead the Democratic National Committee spent Saturday in Florida at a donor summit organized by David Brock that was largely focused on the party's failings in 2016. They quickly realized they were missing a major moment. Back at home, the family of former Labor Secretary Tom Perez -- one of the DNC chair candidates -- was cramming 10 visitors in town for the march into their house. It took Perez -- who said he was "frankly very conflicted" about missing the marches in the first place -- multiple runs to Union Station to drop all his visitors off as they departed Sunday. Perez said beyond Trump's moves on health care and home mortgages and his wealthy Cabinet appointments, Americans already miss the "grace" and "integrity" of President Barack Obama's tenure in office -- and that "there have been more integrity breaches since this election by Trump than any president I can think of." "That's why you see America waking up -- and America is going to stay awake," he said. Another candidate for DNC chair, Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison, said he got a call from his niece, a senior at Emerson College in Boston, who he'd not been able to get involved in the 2016 race -- but who told him by phone Saturday she was inspired by the marches. He said the Democratic Party "must support and partner with the energetic activists we saw -- not just ever so often, but 365 days a year." "We are stronger," Ellison said, "when voters know that our party stands for the human rights and dignity that were highlighted during the marches." "We are stronger," Ellison said, "when voters know that our party stands for the human rights and dignity that were highlighted during the marches." ©White House press secretary Sean Spicer may be getting his just desserts. Dippin' Dots CEO Scott Fischer had a message for Spicer on Monday: Let's be friends. "We've seen your tweets and would like to be friends rather than foes," the head of the flash frozen ice cream company wrote in an Spicer has tweeted four times about the ice cream, which gained popularity in malls and amusement parks in the late 1990s. The old tweets recently went viral as Spicer officially stepped into his new role as the face of the White House's communications team. "Dippin dots is NOT the ice cream of the future," he wrote in 2010, mocking the brand's tagline. In 2011, he called the novelty treat "Ice Cream of the Past." And as recently as September 2015, he voiced more frustration with the brand: "If Dippin Dots was truly the ice cream of the future they would not have run out of vanilla cc @Nationals." The brand filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2011, but has since made a financial comeback, Fischer said. "As you may or may not know, Dippin' Dots are made in Kentucky by hundreds of hard working Americans in the heartland of our great country. As a company, we're doing great. We've enjoyed double-digit growth in sales for the past three years.

But he also brought up two past grievances -- mentioning his inauguration crowd size and reiterating an unsubstantiated claim that 3-5 million illegal votes cost him the popular vote, according to two sources familiar with the meeting. The meeting -- with the top eight House and Senate leaders from both parties -- was mostly social, barely touched on the issues and didn't go into much detail about Trump's policy preferences, Democratic Minority Whip Rep. Steny Hoyer told CNN's Erin Burnett on "OutFront" shortly after the meeting. "This is largely an opportunity for him to get to know members of the leadership that he did not already know," Hoyer said. Trump told the congressional leaders -- including the Democrats -- that it's his intention to provide "something that is better and more affordable" than Obamacare, Republican Sen. John Cornyn said, adding that the Democratic leaders pushed back when he said that. Trump also told the congressional leaders that in the letter that former President Barack Obama left for him, Obama said he could support a bill brought by Trump if it improved upon his signature domestic policy. In Hoyer's retelling, Obama said he would support Trump-backed health care legislation if it provided "greater access, greater health care assurance to people, greater quality and bring costs down." "Yes, President Obama said that, and we agree with that. And we told Trump that we agreed with that. But the fact of the matter is, we haven't seen anything that does that," Hoyer added. Hoyer told CNN's Burnett that Trump also brought up his inauguration crowd size at the gathering. "He didn't change his point of view on the crowd size," Hoyer said. "It was from his perspective a very large crowd ... it was clear this was still on his mind." Trump also reiterated the unsubstantiated claim that 3-5 million illegal votes cost him the popular vote, according to two sources familiar with the meeting. The President has previously made this claim, tweeting in November: "In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally." There has been no evidence of widespread voter fraud, and at the time, many speculated Trump was referencing a series of fake stories on conspiracy websites that said he actually beat Hillary Clinton in the popular vote count. Cornyn said that they also discussed getting his nominees confirmed; and said the group discussed infrastructure spending as an area to find "common ground." But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, made "the important point" that it should be "paid for because we got $20 trillion in debt," Cornyn said. Cornyn added that the group did not discuss the Supreme Court. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said it was a positive meeting but not an in depth policy discussion. It was "about building relationships." Nominations came up and Trump "gently pressed" on his desire to move faster. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer made clear there are nominees the Democrats just don't think are possible with at this point. McConnell told CNN that the meeting was "pretty lighthearted." ' ©The Trump administration's decision to reverse a mortgage-fee cut intended to help low-income borrowers shouldn't have been a surprise. It's a policy, implemented in the final days of the Obama administration, that runs afoul of conservative orthodoxy. Trump's selection to run the Housing and Urban Development Department, Ben Carson, said he was disappointed in the move during his confirmation hearing. What's more, it was a decision, announced by Obama's HUD Secretary Julian Castro, which was made without consulting Trump's team first, according to two people familiar with the matter. But the speed with which it occurred -- less than an hour after Trump took the oath of office last week -- surprised even plugged-in lobbyists, congressional staffers and housing officials, according to a series of interviews with stakeholders by CNN. "Had no idea," said one lobbyist with a laugh. "None." "Wasn't expecting it -- and have absolutely no insight into how it all happened," said another. "Knew it was coming eventually, but damn," mused a congressional staffer. "That was quick." Carson hasn't been confirmed yet. Trump still hasn't even named his own Federal Housing Administration commissioner -- the individual responsible for overseeing the portfolio the fees effect. Most interviewed were perplexed as to who at the agency actually had the power to pull the trigger on something like this. The content of the Trump administration's decision to reverse the decision, at least according to Democrats, was even more problematic. The cut itself is designed to ease the home buying process for first time and low-income homebuyers. It was a decision made amid intense pressure from advocacy groups, according to two people familiar with the process -- one final effort by the administration to bolster that specific group of borrowers on Obama's way out the door. The Trump team's move, especially so quickly after inauguration, infuriated Democrats. "It took only an hour after his positive words on the inaugural platform for his actions to ring hollow," Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor just a few hours later. "One hour after talking about helping working people and ending the cabal in Washington that hurts people, he signs a regulation that makes it more expensive for new homeowners to buy mortgages." Sen. Sherrod Brown, the top Democrat on the Banking Committee, tweeted shortly after: "Making it more expensive for Americans to buy their first homes is not the way to make Washington work for people." But Trump's team, in part out of necessity, and in part, according to sources, to make a point to the departing team at the organization, was prepared to pull the trigger on the shift as soon as Trump placed his hand on the two bibles he used for his swearing in. The primary reason the action was taken immediately was simple, according to multiple people familiar with the process: because it could be done immediately. Unlike most federal rule changes, HUD can operate not only unilaterally on the decision, but without going through traditional rule-making process of doing things like placing the change in the Federal Register for review. A simple letter informing stake holders is all it took to take the action. No official rule-making. No executive orders. Just a letter. It was also done for marketplace reasons. The cut was supposed to take effect on January 27. If the decision was going to be made, better to make it before lenders started utilizing the cut than after. "They did it this way so, quite frankly, all the lenders brokers and machinery didn't bake the wrong premiums into the cake," said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, the former chief economist of President George W. Bush's Council of Economic advisers and then director of the Congressional Budget Office. "This is the efficient way to get it fixed as opposed to put it into effect" and having lenders have to backtrack later. The move was also deliberately telegraphed in advance, according to one official who worked on the process. Two GOP senators made a point of asking Carson questions about the issue during his confirmation hearing -- an effort to lay the groundwork for the eventual move, the official said. Republicans had made no secret of their disdain for the Obama administration's decision. The reasons are two-fold: The cut reduces the government's cushion backing the mortgages. By targeting lower-income borrowers, it also makes the makeup of the risk pool worse. Even lobbyists whose members would benefit from the cut knew where things were headed under Trump. "It was relatively clear where a lot of Republicans in Congress stood," one told CNN. Trump's landing teams, which had arrived at HUD weeks ago, had targeted the reversal early on the process, a person familiar with the process said. Apart from the logistical and policy reasons, another was general frustration with Obama's decision to make the cut at all. Obama's team hadn't consulted with Trump's before making the move -- or even told them it was coming, the person said. Carson hinted at that frustration during his confirmation hearing. "I was surprised to see something of this nature done on the way out the door," he told lawmakers. As to who actually did it?

The move, which had long been promised by the Trump administration, does not include military employees, a fact Trump made clear during the signing. But research shows that federal hiring freezes regularly hurt veterans more than other groups and cost the government more because they lead to boosts in contracting. "This memorandum counters the dramatic expansion of the federal workforce in recent years," Sean Spicer, Trump's press secretary, said Monday. "In particular, it prevents filling vacant positions and creating new positions except when necessary to meet national or public security responsibilities." He added: "It does not apply to military personnel, and it ensures that the American taxpayers get effective and efficient government." In an effort to counter what other hiring freezes have found, the action says it prevent the hiring of federal contractors: "Contracting outside the Government to circumvent the intent of this memorandum shall not be permitted." A 1982 Government Accountability Office report on hiring freezes found, though, that hiring freezes implemented by Presidents Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter "had little effect on Federal employment levels." "Because they ignored individual agencies' missions, workload, and staffing requirements, these freezes disrupted agency operations, and in some cases, increased costs to the Government," And while Trump's executive action makes good on a promise the Republican made on the campaign trail, his press secretary's claim that there has been a "dramatic expansion of the federal workforce" is inaccurate. Total executive branch federal government employment -- not including uniformed military personnel and legislative and judicial branch personnel -- has dropped dramatically since the high point in the late 1980s and early 1990s when it averaged about 3 million employees. In recent years (such as 2009-2014) it has continued to decrease, at a slower rate, from 2.77 in 2009 to 2.66 in 2014. The American Federation of Government Employees, the primary union that represented federal employees, blasted the announcement. "President Trump's action will disrupt government programs and services that benefit everyone and actually increase taxpayer costs by forcing agencies to hire more expensive contractors to do work that civilian government employees are already doing for far less," J. David Cox Sr., the group's president, said in a statement. There are also concerns that a hiring freeze will adversely impact veterans, many of whom leave service and hope to land federal government jobs. A A ©It's Day 4 of the Trump administration, and the President had a busy day to kick off his first work week. Three executive actions and meetings with both CEOs and union leaders are among the highlights. White House press secretary Sean Spicer held court with the press for over an hour, hitting topics ranging from Obamacare to immigration. ©US investigators are scrutinizing late December calls between Mike Flynn, President Donald Trump's national security adviser, and Russia's ambassador to the US as part of a broader counterintelligence investigation of Russian activities in the US, law enforcement and intelligence officials told CNN. The calls were captured by routine US eavesdropping targeting the Russian diplomats, according to the intelligence and law enforcement officials. But the officials said some of the content of the conversation raised enough potential concerns that investigators are still looking into the discussions, amid a broader concern about Russian intelligence-gathering activities in the United States. The officials all stressed that so far there has been no determination of any wrongdoing. FBI and intelligence officials briefed members of the Obama White House team before President Barack Obama left office about the Flynn calls to the Russian ambassador, sources said. At a press briefing Monday, Trump press secretary Sean Spicer said he had discussed the issue with Flynn on Sunday. Spicer said there had been two calls between Flynn and the Russian ambassador and that they covered only four subjects: Setting up a call between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin; exchanging holiday greetings; offering condolences for lives lost in a Russian plane crash; and a Syria conference on ISIS. In a statement Sunday night, a spokesman for Trump had said the White House has "absolutely no knowledge of any investigation or even a basis for such an investigation." The calls were heard in the course of monitoring of communications of Russian diplomats, the officials said. US intelligence agencies routinely capture communications of senior foreign officials, including those based in the US, other intelligence officials said. The Wall Street Journal was first to report that investigators had looked at the calls. Among the communications being scrutinized are calls between Russia's ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, and Flynn on December 29. The calls came on the same day the US announced further sanctions against Russia and expelled a group of 35 Russian diplomats the US had accused of spying. A Trump official told CNN on January 16th that Flynn and Kislyak did not discuss the Russian sanctions. On the same day, multiple Trump officials said the call focused on the logistics of connecting Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin after the inauguration for a phone conversation. Flynn and Kislyak had talked other times, including in the wake of the shooting of the Russian ambassador to Turkey, in which Flynn expressed his condolences, according to the Trump official CNN spoke to on January 16th. The men also exchanged holiday pleasantries via text on December 28th, the Trump official said. The FBI, along with the CIA, National Security Agency and Treasury Department, has assembled a task force to focus on increased Russian spying efforts in the US -- an investigative effort that includes meddling in the US election and alleged dealings with several people tied to Trump. Investigators collected communications during the course of the presidential campaign between people believed to be intermediaries of the Russian government and Trump surrogates and others associated with the president's 2016 election campaign. None of the other people known to be under scrutiny are part of the new Trump administration. Still, the revelation that the calls of the new White House national security adviser were investigated creates a difficult situation for law enforcement and the intelligence community, which has been at odds with the new Trump administration over its handling of the Russian hackings. This weekend, Trump went to the CIA for his first official stop as a president, an effort to mend what had been incredible tension between the two groups. The Trump administration has been particularly incensed by the leaking of a story first reported by CNN that intelligence chiefs and the FBI director, at a briefing for then-President-elect Trump, presented a summary of unsubstantiated accusations from a political opposition research memo regarding alleged Russian efforts to compromise Trump. On Sunday, FBI Director James Comey was at a White House event where Trump honored first responders. Reporters in the room said Trump called out to Comey who walked over and shook hands with the president. The president appeared to whisper something to the FBI director, although what was said could not be heard.

The vote was 66-32 in favor of confirmation, with Pompeo picking up some Democratic backing. The only Republican in opposition was Sen. Rand Paul. The vote was held open longer than normal in an effort to let Senators delayed by the storm in the Northeast reach Washington, but it was gaveled closed before Sens. Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal could arrive. Vice President Mike Pence swore in Pompeo, a Kansas congressman, after the vote at the White House. "I just want to remind our colleagues that our country continues to face incredible threats, and they are not hitting the pause button," Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, said in a statement issued before he voted in support of Pompeo. "The President needs his national security Cabinet, and particularly his CIA Director at his side, a Cabinet position integral to keeping our country safe." Pompeo's view on electronic surveillance and torture drew the ire of some Democrats. But Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Democratic Socialist from Vermont, cited Pompeo's support for the broad collection of metadata in his vote against the CIA nominee. "What we are talking about is the United States government having in many ways more information about us than we may even understand about our own life," Sanders said. "In many ways, it sounds to me like we are moving toward an Orwellian society." Sen. Ron Wyden, a Oregon Democrat, has been the most vocal opponent of Pompeo's nomination and had called for more time to debate the congressman's positions. In a deal reached among Senate leaders, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced Friday night that the Senate would allow six hours for debate on Pompeo's nomination before a vote on confirmation. Pompeo drew criticism last week when he told Congress that In a series of written responses on Wednesday to questions from members of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Pompeo said that while current permitted interrogation techniques are limited to those in the Army Field Manual, he was open to making changes to that policy. "If confirmed, I will consult with experts at the Agency and at other organizations in the US government on whether the Army Field Manual uniform application is an impediment to gathering vital intelligence to protect the country," he wrote. "If experts believed current law was an impediment to gathering vital intelligence to protect the country, I would want to understand such impediments and whether any recommendations were appropriate for changing current law." During his Senate confirmation hearing on Thursday, however, he had dismissed the idea that he would approve of torture as CIA chief. Pompeo also addressed Russia, China and the Middle East at the hearing, defending the agency's findings about alleged Moscow hacking during the election even as Trump had suggested that the Intelligence Community's determinations of Russian meddling were overblown. Pompeo told the Senate that he embraced findings spelled out in a comprehensive report of the Intelligence Community on the Russian breaches compiled earlier this month. "With respect to this report in particular, it's pretty clear about what took place here, about Russian involvement in efforts to hack information and to have an impact on American democracy," he said in response to questioning. "This was an aggressive action taken by senior leadership inside of Russia." In his opening remarks, Pompeo listed Russia as well as China as "sophisticated adversaries" in the cyber realm, saying "hackers are all taking advantage of this new borderless environment" and "the CIA must continue to be at the forefront of this issue." Along with Russia, Pompeo said other global threats include Iran's growing influence in the Middle East, ISIS's grip over major urban areas and the conflict in Syria. "This is the most complicated threat environment the United States has seen in recent memory," he said.

We'll be covering it all here. ©White House press secretary Sean Spicer met the press for his first official briefing Monday, engaging in a wide-ranging give-and-take for well over an hour. The briefing was rife with news: Spicer did not rule out joint military activity with Russia in Syria, said the United States would challenge China in the South China Sea in an effort to defend the interests of the United States and discussed the current state of the left over Obama administration immigration actions. Spicer notably said Monday that the United States would defend its "I think the US is going to make sure we protect our interests there," Spicer said. "If those islands are, in fact, in international waters and not part of China proper, yeah, we'll make sure we defend international interests from being taken over by one country." At a regular press conference Tuesday, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Beijing's position "hasn't changed." "China will firmly protect its sovereignty and maritime rights in the South China Sea," she said. "We urge the US side to respect facts as well as exercise caution in its remarks and actions to avoid harming peace and stability in the South China Sea." Spicer said Monday that Trump is open to working "with any country" when it comes to defeating ISIS. "I think if there's a way that we can combat ISIS with any country, whether it's Russia or anyone else, and we have a shared national interest in that, sure we'll take it," Spicer said. Trump campaigned on a platform that included Asked directly whether the Trump administration would work with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to defeat ISIS, Spicer said: "Let's not take that too far." "We are going to smartly do this," Spicer said. "We're not going to get together with people under guise of defeating ISIS if that's not truly their guise." Spicer said there are "no decisions" about when and whether the United States will move its embassy The move would be sure to anger the United States' Arab allies in the region, because both the Israelis and the Palestinian lay claim to Jerusalem. "We're at the very early stages of that decision-making process," Spicer said, despite some reports to the contrary. Spicer later said that the Trump administration is going to "continue to consult with stakeholders as we get there." Trump told CNN in March that moving the embassy would happen "very quickly." Spicer said that Trump has not talked to "anyone specifically about" about US investigators scrutinizing But Trump "has not made any indication he would stop an investigation of any sort," he said. The investigations, law enforcement and intelligence officials tell CNN, are part of a broader counterintelligence probe of Russian activities in the US. Immigration, possibly more than any other issue, animated much of Trump's campaign. Spicer was less committal on Monday, suggesting that actions like repealing DACA and DAPA were going to happen later. "First and foremost, the President's been very, very clear that we need to direct agencies to focus on those who are in this country illegally and have a record -- a criminal record or poses a threat to the American people," Spicer said. "That's where the priorities going to be and then we're going to continue to work through the entire number of folks that are here illegally. But right now the clear focus is on that." Spicer later said that the administration's focus is "people who've overstayed their visas, people who have committed crime." In a move the highlights the importance of the Middle East and the Arab world, Spicer said Monday that Trump spoke with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi on Monday. "They discussed ways to deepen the bilateral relationship and support Egypt's fight against terrorists and bolster Egypt's home- grown historic economic reform program," Spicer said. "President Trump underscored the United States remains strongly committed to the bilateral relationship, which has helped both countries overcome challenges in the region for decades." Spicer also said "the two leaders discussed a visit to the United States in the future." After offering a slew of falsehoods regarding the size of crowds at Trump's inauguration in a statement on Saturday, Spicer was pushed on Monday about Spicer said it was his intention to tell the truth from the podium but that sometimes he will disagree with reporters about facts. "There are certain things that we may not fully understand when we come out. But our intention's never to lie to you," he said. "I'm going to come out here and tell you the facts as I know them. And if we make a mistake, we'll do our best to correct it." Spicer, however, did not apologize or back away from some of the incorrect claims he made on Saturday. Spicer stuck by the defensive stance the administration has taken regarding the size of crowds at the President's inauguration by arguing that the way Trump is covering is "demoralizing." "It's a little demoralizing to turn on the TV day after day and hear, (he) can't do this, this guy's not going to get confirmed, not way they're going to go through," Spicer said. Spicer repeatedly used the word "demoralizing" to describe the coverage of Trump. "Whether it's the President himself, the vice president, the senior team, the volunteers or the people who are out there just in America that voted for him or walked the streets or put up a sign, that to constantly be told 'no, no, no' and watch him go 'yes, yes, yes' every time and to come up to the next hurdle and see someone put a block up gets a little frustrating," Spicer said. He added: "The default narrative is always negative and it's demoralizing." After Republicans refused to give "I think we will have a nomination within the next couple weeks. He continues to make that a priority of his," Spicer said. "I think we will have a nomination within the next couple weeks.

The team of reporters, researchers and editors across CNN listened throughout the event and analyzed key statements, rating them true, misleading or false. By Eve Bower, CNN Spicer criticized Senate Democrats, saying they were "playing political games" and delaying the confirmation of the majority of Trump's Cabinet nominees. Spicer said that at this point during President Barack Obama's first term, in 2009, seven of his nominees had been confirmed, compared to Trump's two. It is It is also Late last week, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer left open the possibility that, by the end of the day Monday, the nominee to lead the CIA, Rep. Mike Pompeo, and some other "non-controversial" nominees may be confirmed as well. Schumer also said that the confirmation process would be expedited if the nominees all submitted their ethics paperwork and allowed "a day or two" for any questions. Of the 21 nominees who had been named by last Monday, required paperwork was still missing for seven of those. Here's a list of the seven nominees approved by the end of Obama's first full day in office (Wednesday, January 21, 2009): 1. Tom Vilsack (Agriculture -- 1/20) 2. Arne Duncan (Education -- 1/20) 3. Steven Chu (Energy -- 1/20) 4. Janet Napolitano (Homeland Security -- 1/20) 5. Ken Salazar - (Interior -- 1/20) 6. Hilda Solis (Labor -- 1/20) 7. Hillary Clinton (State -- 1/21) By Tami Luhby, CNNMoney Asked whether Trump feels he has a mandate to make major changes to Obamacare, Spicer said the health care law is not living up to its promises. "You go around this country and look market after market, they are down to one plan," he said. "That's not what the American people were promised. Not only that, but in many cases, you are seeing the rates go up 10, 15, 20, 30, 50%. That's not what was promised either." It's As for the increase in rates, the average monthly premium for the 2017 benchmark silver plan rose 22%, according to Department of Health and Human Services statistics. But the average masks wide variations underneath. In some places it fell slightly, such as Vice President Mike Pence's home state of Indiana, where it fell 3% on average. In others, it jumped much more. Trump likes to point to Arizona -- where the average jumped 116% -- as a sign of Obamacare's failure. Many plans did see increases in the 10% to 50% range. So we rate Spicer's comments on Obamacare as By Sonam Vashi, CNN Spicer doubled down on his claim Saturday that Trump's inauguration had the biggest audience of any presidential swearing-in -- ever. "You look at just one network alone got 16.9 million people online. Another couple of the networks; there were tens of millions watched it online. Never mind the audience that was here: 31 million people watched it on television. Combine that with the tens of millions of people that watched it online, on a device. It's unquestionable ... I'm saying if you add up all of the various live streaming that we have information on so far, I don't think there is any question -- it was the largest watched inauguration ever." But we're still questioning that. About Trump's ceremony likely did edge out Obama's online. On Friday, (Spicer cites a "16.9 million" figure, which is the number of starts CNN had on its live stream Friday. However, the same person can visit a live stream multiple times and be counted in that figure each time. So looking at the maximum number of concurrent users, or when the number of people watching simultaneously was at its highest, is often a better estimate to compare a total active audience.) Many other websites streamed Friday's inaugural ceremony. Akamai Technologies, which supports live streaming services on several sites, If we add in these best available online numbers to the cable views, Trump's inauguration had at least 37.5 million viewers, compared to the at least 42.9 million who watched Obama's in 2009. That's not even counting the fact that By Dan Merica, CNN Spicer defended Trump's decision to back out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership on Monday by arguing bilateral agreements between two countries are more beneficial for American workers. Spicer went on to defend this decision by arguing "bilateral deals are mostly what China has been engaging in." While China has sought to enter into a major trade deal that would act as a backup should the TPP fall through, the majority of trade deals China is either exploring or that it has entered into are bilateral. Of the trade deals China has signed and are in effect, 14 of 16 are bilateral, as are seven of the nine trade deals China is negotiating, according to the Asia Regional Integration Center. That said, China has been a major driver behind the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, a massive 16-nation proposed trade deal that would link sizable countries like India, China and South Korea with smaller countries like Cambodia, Indonesia and Laos. The trade deal, which would be smaller than the TPP, would allow China to assert itself in the region, should TPP crumble. Because the majority of trade deals China has either entered into or are in the process of negotiating are bilateral, we rate this claim By Dan Merica, CNN Trump signed an executive action on Monday that implemented a hiring freeze for some federal workers in an effort to cut government payroll, and Spicer said the action would stop the "dramatic expansion of the federal workforce in recent years." Figures from the Office of Personnel Management show, however, the size of the federal employee workforce has declined under the Obama administration. Total executive branch federal employment -- not including uniformed military personnel and legislative and judicial branch personnel -- Trump's move is more symbolic than anything. The executive action makes good on a promise the Republican made on the campaign trail and mimics promises that Presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan made.

Sen. Marco Rubio was a long hold-out and potential "no" vote after he raised concerns about Tillerson's views toward Russia and human rights. But the Florida Republican announced earlier Monday that A final confirmation vote by the full Senate is expected next week, according to leadership aides from each party. Monday's committee vote split along party lines, with Republicans backing Trump's nominee and Democrats opposing. During the vote, Rubio said he still had reservations about Tillerson, but looked favorably on the Texan's support for NATO and his recognition that "Russia's claims on Crimea are illegitimate." Rubio said he came around to supporting the nominee because "given the uncertainty that exists both at home and abroad about the direction of our foreign policy, it would be against our national interests to have this confirmation unnecessarily delayed or embroiled in controversy." The committee's Republican chairman, Sen. Robert Corker of Tennessee, said "diplomacy has been a critical component" of Tillerson's job at ExxonMobil and praised him as an "adept negotiator" with relationships around the world. But the Democrats catalogued a series of concerns, including his stance on Russia, human rights, how long he would recuse himself from decisions that could affect ExxonMobil, and the oil company's track record of doing business with despots. Sen. Robert Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, said he was troubled by Tillerson's answers on human rights and on ExxonMobil's efforts to avoid or lobby against sanctions on Iran and other countries. "If I am to vote affirmatively for a nominee, I need honest and transparent answers," Menendez said. "I simply do not feel I got them from Mr. Tillerson." Menendez also returned to a focus of his questions to Tillerson during the hearing last week, saying that "it is incredibly troublesome that Mr. Tillerson and President Trump had not even discussed the specifics of their Russia policy." Environmental groups and peace advocates expressed dismay at Tillerson's nomination. "If the Senate wanted a human rights-violating, climate-denying, fact-bending chief diplomat, then they got their man," said Friends of the Earth president Erich Pica. During his confirmation hearing, Tillerson had faced a grilling about his close ties to Russia and whether his business experience could translate into diplomatic skills. His answers about human rights riled both Democrats and Republicans like Rubio, who told the lifelong businessman at his confirmation hearing that US foreign policy needed a "moral clarity" he wasn't hearing. After Rubio met for 90 minutes with Tillerson last week and got answers to more than 100 written questions he'd asked the nominee to answer, the Florida senator said that "despite my reservations, I will support Mr. Tillerson's nomination in committee and in the full Senate." Rubio was one of just three Senate Republicans who had been Tillerson's nomination hearing last week was notable for the number of ways he diverged from Trump on policy questions. The Texan denounced Russian aggression in Ukraine, said he believes climate change is real, advocated for the benefits of the NATO alliance, and supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership that Trump pulled the US from by executive order Monday.

Brady, a day after According to Trump, who made the remarks at a pre-inaugural dinner that included Patriots owner Robert Kraft, Brady called the new president to offer his congratulations before the inauguration. On Monday, Brady was asked if he would confirm he had called him. "I have called him, yes, in the past," Brady said. "Sometimes he calls me. Sometimes I call him. But, again, that's been someone I've known. I always try to keep it in context because for 16 years you know someone before maybe he was in the position that he was in. He's been very supportive of me for a long time. It's just a friendship. I have a lot of friends. I call a lot of people." Brady added: "Why does that make such a big deal? I don't understand that." Brady then was asked on the show about having conversations with women who may not like Trump. "I don't want to get into it, but if you know someone, it doesn't mean you agree with everything they say or they do," Brady said. "You have a lot of friends in your life. I think there are things that are based in your own dealings with someone that is a personal dealing, not a public dealing. Because you have personal experiences."

Surrounded by a crowd of men, for which he was widely derided on social media once pictures began circulating, Trump signed the policy, initially put in place by the Reagan administration, but was rescinded by the Obama administration in 2009. "The President, it's no secret, has made it very clear that he's a pro-life president," White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told reporters at his first daily briefing. "He wants to stand up for all Americans, including the unborn, and I think the reinstatement of this policy is not just something that echoes that value, but respects taxpayer funding as well." Even during the Obama years, US law banned direct funding for abortion services. But NGOs that performed the procedure were allowed to receive US funding for other programs, including those related to contraception access and post-abortion care. Now, NGOs that offer or promote abortions as part of their family planning services will be prevented from receiving any assistance from the US Agency for International Development, one of the largest contributors to international development assistance. Trump's decision was labeled as "catastrophic," leading to women in developing countries "paying the price," according to Marie Stopes International's vice-president and director of the organization's international operations Marjorie Newman-Williams. According to the charity, the loss of its services during Trump's first term could cause 6.5 million unintended pregnancies, 2.2 million abortions, 2.1 million unsafe abortions, and 21,700 maternal deaths. The organization also said it will also be prevented from reaching 1.5 million women with contraception every year. "All the medical evidence, as well as everything we know from our daily interactions with women, is unequivocal: If you take safe abortion services out of the reproductive healthcare package, it exposes women to risk," Newman-Williams said. "Attempts to stop abortion through restrictive laws -- or by withholding family planning aid -- will never work, because they do not eliminate women's need for abortion," added Newman-Williams. "This policy only exacerbates the already significant challenge of ensuring that people in the developing world who want to time and space their children can obtain the contraception they need to do so." Marie Stopes International also said that it gave 2,843 general and gynecological checkups and performed 586 contraceptive implant insertions in the wake of the 2015 earthquake in Nepal -- Nancy Northup, The policy has been enforced off and on since it first took effect in 1985. Democratic administrations have traditionally rescinded the policy, while Republican administrations have reinstated it. Reaction from Democrats and abortion rights activists was swift. In a statement issued shortly after the action was signed, NARAL Pro-Choice America slammed the move. "Donald Trump has turned his anti-women rhetoric into policy, and made it more difficult for women and families all over the world to access vital reproductive care. He really is living up to the lowest of expectations," NARAL's president, Ilyse Hogue, wrote. New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen took to Twitter to announce that she would put forward a bill repealing the policy permanently. Such a bill would end the cycle of repeals and reinstatements the policy has seen over the years, but would be unlikely to pass a majority-Republican Congress. Meanwhile, conservatives in Congress and anti-abortion activists are applauding Trump for signing the executive action. "For yrs, U.S. has debated abortion," Sen. James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican, tweeted Monday. "At least we can agree no taxpayer should be forced to pay for it." "President Trump is continuing Ronald Reagan's legacy by taking immediate action on day one to stop the promotion of abortion through our tax dollars overseas." Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the anti-abortion advocacy group Susan B. Anthony List. "President Trump's immediate action to promote respect for all human life, including vulnerable unborn children abroad, as well as conscience rights, sends a strong signal about his administration's pro-life priorities."

"Great thing for the American worker, what we just did," Trump told reporters Monday in the Oval Office as he signed the order. Here's what you need to know about Trump's move: Trump formally withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership -- a 12-nation deal that had been negotiated under former President Barack Obama. Nothing changes because of Trump's move. Congress had not yet approved the TPP -- its fate was bleak on Capitol Hill no matter what the White House did -- and the deal had not yet taken effect. However, by pulling the United States out of the deal, Trump fulfilled a campaign promise. And in doing so, he ends all hopes for a deal Obama wanted as a major part of his legacy. The TPP -- which has also included Canada, Mexico, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Chile, Peru, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam and Brunei -- would have slashed tariffs for American imports and exports with those countries. In exchange, the United States had negotiated labor, environmental and intellectual property protections that major businesses sought. The deal's critics complained that it didn't directly address the issue of currency manipulation. Trump on Sunday announced he'd start to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. On Monday, he pulled the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. He has now taken firm control of the trade rules he long decried, and is in position to reverse decades of American presidents pushing for lower trade barriers and an interconnected global economy. In other words: Now, the pressure is really on. Trump's bet is that, through his negotiating prowess, force of will and willingness to walk away from the table, he can convince other countries to accept terms that previous presidents -- from George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton on NAFTA to Barack Obama on the TPP -- have not been able to achieve. The task is difficult -- even though Trump's move to withdraw from the TPP is likely to be politically popular. Even Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders -- a leading Trump critic -- praised it, saying he is "glad the Trans-Pacific Partnership is dead and gone." "Now is the time to develop a new trade policy that helps working families, not just multi-national corporations," Sanders said in a statement. "If President Trump is serious about a new policy to help American workers then I would be delighted to work with him." Until Trump negotiates his own bargains, he's betting he can reverse the decades-long trend of globalization. He faces a lot of skeptics. Big businesses are howling that Trump is undercutting their ability to sell to the vast majority of the world's consumers -- a particularly damaging move if manufacturing jobs that have already left the United States are gone for good. Republicans have long supported free trade -- and now find themselves torn between a protectionist President and a business community that sees Trump's position as detached from the reality that new technology, rising wages and an increasingly interconnected world mean that many manufacturing and low-skill jobs won't return to the United States; that goods are sold cheaper in the United States because they are made overseas; and that American companies also benefit from trade deals, making trillions of dollars selling their own products oversees. Those GOP principles were on display in the reaction to Trump's move. "I don't see any benefit in trying to crawl back into our shell as a country," Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, R-Texas, told CNN. "It's clear that those of us who believe trade is good for American families have done a terrible job defending trade's historic successes and celebrating its future potential. We have to make the arguments and we have to start now," Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse said in a statement. Because the TPP hadn't taken effect, there will be no immediate impact. Quantifying what it means the United States is foregoing by turning down what would have been a deal including countries that make up 40% of the global economy -- both in terms of jobs retained and business lost -- is difficult, and numbers offered by both critics and advocates of the deal are disputed. But labor groups -- some of which are scheduled to meet Trump Monday at the White House -- are sure to celebrate the move. They've long argued it would continue a trend of shifting American manufacturing jobs overseas to nations with lower wages and fewer labor protections. Businesses will also lose access to potential new markets, though. US automakers hoped to see tariffs slashed in Asia. Farmers were set to see the removal of trade taxes that currently prevent them from selling products, particularly poultry, overseas. Pharmaceutical drug-makers had received years of patent protection that would have lessened the competition from generics in Asia. And tech companies, from Google to cell phone providers, sought to lessen regulations and gain entry into some of the countries involved in the deal. "This decision will forfeit the opportunity to promote American exports, reduce trade barriers, open new markets, and protect American invention and innovation," Arizona Sen. John McCain said in a statement critical of Trump's executive action. Best-case scenario for the United States: Nothing at all, since China wasn't involved in the TPP. But already, Chinese leaders are angling to take the United States' place and expand the country's influence in the region. "We must remain committed to promoting free trade and investment through opening up and say no to protectionism," Chinese President Xi Jinping said in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos last week. Obama had pitched the TPP as a way to counter China's growing influence by imposing US-backed labor, environmental and patent protections. China is unlikely to seek or support such protections in its own trade negotiations -- allowing those countries to produce cheaper goods, but with fewer worker protections. The 11 remaining TPP nations are now set to regroup. Trade ministers from those nations say they intend to press forward with the deal -- but the United States' withdrawal could mean a major rewrite, or an opening for another global superpower to pursue an alternative agreement.

The President is going to start hitting the Washington dinner party circuit. In most cases, actually, his guests will come to him as he tries building bridges in a city that he has spent years railing against. "It's very good -- a beautiful relationship," said Trump, all smiles Monday as he hosted congressional leaders at the White House for his first round of evening visitors. A piano played Billy Joel's "New York State of Mind," as the President mingled with top Republicans and Democrats, all of whom are feeling their way in Trump's new Washington. The President's aides have one thing in mind as he adjusts to his new surroundings: keeping the boss busy. People close to Trump's team acknowledged that his first weekend in office had been overtaken by the President engaging in a fight over crowd sizes and media coverage he perceived as negative. Alarmed Republicans urged allies inside the West Wing to instill discipline on the President's message. With his wife, Melania, and son, Barron, back in New York, Trump has asked his advisers to stretch his schedule from daytime to nighttime, creating a far different environment at the White House than the last eight years. President Barack Obama left the Oval Office punctually for dinner with his young family on most nights, before returning to work later in the evening. President George W. Bush started and ended his days far earlier. Not since President Bill Clinton has the midnight oil routinely burned in the White House, where policy discussions and strategy sessions often went into the night. Trump will likely strike a balance somewhere between his three predecessors. Kellyanne Conway, counselor to Trump, said the President's schedule will include working dinners most every evening. She said he plans to even hold some type of media dinners, despite his self-proclaimed war with the press. On his first full weekday in office, it quickly became clear how eager Trump was to show his visitors around the West Wing, particularly the Oval Office. He held six separate photo opportunities Monday alone, including two with a group of union leaders who he summoned for a picture behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office after a meeting nearby in the Roosevelt Room ended. Sean McGarvey, president of the North America's Building Trades Union, was beaming after he left. "He took the time to take everyone into the Oval Office and show them the seat of power in the world," McGarvey said outside the White House. "The respect that the President of the United States just showed us ... was nothing short of incredible." Invitations are starting to go out across Washington to visit Trump, aides said, including adversaries like members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the Congressional Black Caucus. "He is someone who really enjoys that kind of conversation," White House press secretary Sean Spicer said. "I think you are going to see lot of meetings occur like the ones that he did today." It's an open question how some Democratic groups will react to Trump's invitations. Eight years ago, several Republican lawmakers declined social invitations to the Obama White House, fearful of being seen as too cozy with the Democratic president. For Trump, it's a new challenge. But as he held court with Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and their Republican counterparts Monday evening, all of whom later described the meeting as fairly free of deep substance, he declared: "We're about to make a big deal."

The The ©The White House is spotlighting its support of the law enforcement community in a new statement on the White House website that declares: "The dangerous anti-police atmosphere in America is wrong." The page is dedicated to the administration's commitment to "law and order" -- a message carried over from the campaign trail. "President Trump will honor our men and women in uniform and will support their mission of protecting the public. The dangerous anti-police atmosphere in America is wrong. The Trump Administration will end it," the statement reads. Police violence has been at the forefront of nationwide tensions, after a number of police encounters with unarmed African-Americans resulted in death, which sparked massive protests across the country in 2016. In July, the presidential candidate Donald Trump "Certainly, in certain instances they are," he said to Fox News host Bill O'Reilly when he asked whether the group had been "a fuse-lighter in the assassinations of these police officers." "They certainly have ignited people and you see that ... It's a very, very serious situation and we just can't let it happen," Trump said. Also in July, former President Barack Obama talked to reporters "When people say 'black lives matter,' it doesn't mean that blue lives don't matter," Obama said, referring to police officers. "But right now, the data shows that black folks are more vulnerable to these kinds of incidents. There is a particular burden that is being placed on a group of our fellow citizens." But the new administration is taking a tougher stance. "Our job is not to make life more comfortable for the rioter, the looter, or the violent disrupter. Our job is to make life more comfortable for parents who want their kids to be able to walk the streets safely. Or the senior citizen waiting for a bus. Or the young child walking home from school," the White House website reads. "Supporting law enforcement means supporting our citizens' ability to protect themselves. We will uphold Americans' Second Amendment rights at every level of our judicial system."

The tweets were up for a few hours before they were deleted. "Today, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is higher than at any time in the last 650,000 years. #climate," one of the tweets read. In a statement, the National Park Service blamed "a former employee who was not currently authorized to use the park's account" for the tweets, which the NPS said they deleted of their own accord. "The park was not told to remove the tweets but chose to do so when they realized that their account had been compromised. At this time, National Park Service social media managers are encouraged to continue the use of Twitter to post information relating to public safety and park information, with the exception of content related to national policy issues," the National Park Service statement said. Trump once called climate change a "hoax" invented by the Chinese and, during his campaign for president, repeatedly questioned scientific conclusions that human activity has caused global warming. More recently, he has acknowledged "some connectivity" between human activity and climate change. Democrats were quick to criticize the move. Adrienne Watson, the Democratic National Committee national press secretary, said in a statement: "Vladimir Putin would be proud." This isn't the first time an account has gone rogue in response to Trump's administration. On Friday, the National Park Service retweeted messages that compared the crowd sizes at Barack Obama's 2009 inauguration to Donald Trump's inauguration Friday. Representatives from the new administration asked the Interior Department's digital team to temporarily stop using Twitter as well -- a decision the agency now claims was out of a concern the account was hacked. Twitter told CNN that the @BadlandsNPS Twitter account had 7,000 Twitter followers on Monday. It now has 119,000 followers since publication, a number that continues to rise. ©Sen. Lamar Alexander rejected a Democrat's request for a second hearing with Betsy DeVos on Monday, sparing Trump's pick for secretary of education from what would surely be a contentious hearing. Alexander, the Republican chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor & Pensions, traded letters with Sen. Patty Murray, the ranking Democrat, who requested a second hearing for DeVos after all of her paperwork was approved by the Office of Government Ethics. Even pro-Trump Republicans conceded that DeVos' The hearing led many Democrats to believe that DeVos, a woman who straddles two immensely wealthy and politically active Republican families, could be their best chance to thwart a Trump cabinet nominee from getting approved. "I have carefully considered the request and decided not to schedule a second hearing, and here is why: Already Mrs. DeVos has spent considerably more time answering questions of committee members than either of President Obama's education secretaries," Alexander wrote in his letter to Murray. "I do not know why our committee should treat a Republican nominee so differently than the nominee of a Democratic president." It is no surprise that Alexander would not allow a second event. The chairman only allowed one round of questioning during the first hearing, arguing that he was following the "golden rule" because that is how former President Barack Obama's two education secretaries were treated. "We were extremely disappointed at what happened at the hearing last week for Elisabeth 'Betsy' DeVos, President Trump's nominee to be Secretary of Education," Murray wrote in her letter to Alexander. Like several of Trump's Cabinet picks, DeVos has tremendous wealth. Forbes estimates DeVos and her husband, Dick, are worth upwards of $5 billion. She has also donated to at least four of the senators who heard her testimony on Tuesday. She has also given millions to groups that advocate for school privatization and voucher programs, including the American Federation for Children, a group she chaired from 2009 to 2016. DeVos' conflict of interest paperwork is complicated because of her wealth and the Office of Government Ethics had not approved her paperwork before her confirmation hearing. The government ethics office approved her paperwork last week, however, leading Senate Democrats to argue they deserve another round of questioning now that her paperwork is available. "We would like to ask Ms. DeVos additional questions we were prevented from asking this week given we did not know all of the financial and ethical information that has now been shared with us, as well as address additional questions that have arisen from the OGE paperwork," Murray wrote. Alexander rejected that argument in his letter, writing that DeVos is currently answering "837 written follow-up questions," some which have to do with her financial information. The Senate committee will vote on DeVos' nomination on January 31, a week later than what Alexander originally proposed.

In their first major bid to force Trump's hand on a policy issue where the President's populism is at odds with congressional GOP leadership, top Democrats unveiled their infrastructure package Tuesday. "We have heard Mr. Trump's talk of disaster and third-world infrastructure, and we agree something must be done. So we hope the President will join us," Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said at a news conference unveiling the proposal Tuesday. "And we call on the President to persuade his Republican colleagues in the House and Senate to drop their opposition to investing in infrastructure and get on board with this plan." The issue could become an early test of whether Trump's willingness during the campaign to break with Republican leaders has carried into the White House -- or if he will show patience for GOP lawmakers through a lengthy legislative process and instead target Democrats. Before his inauguration, Trump made clear he intended to elevate Schumer as his chief opponent on Capitol Hill -- tweeting that his fellow New Yorker is Democrats' "head clown." But on Inauguration Day, the two were seen speaking at length at a congressional luncheon for Trump. The two evidently got along Monday when Trump called both parties' House and Senate leaders to the White House for a meeting, too. "I enjoyed the President and Sen. Schumer talking about all the people they knew in New York," Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, deadpanned after Monday's meeting. Schumer said he's spoken with Trump at length about infrastructure, too. "I told him repeatedly, 'If you want to do a bill like this, you're going to have to tell a lot of your Republicans -- particularly on the right wing -- that they're not going to get their way,' " Schumer said. "And he acknowledged that. So we'll see what happens." Tuesday's $1 trillion proposal would potentially create 15 million jobs over 10 years, Democrats said. It includes $210 billion for road and bridge repair, $110 billion for water and sewer programs, $180 billion for rail and bus systems, $200 billion for new projects deemed as vital, $75 billion to rebuild schools, $70 billion for ports and $100 billion for energy grid upgrades. Democrats said they were insisting on using tax dollars to pay for the package, rather than tax credits, as Trump advisers and Republicans have floated. "President Trump campaigned on rebuilding the infrastructure," Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said at Tuesday's news conference. "Let's do it -- but let's do it in a way that doesn't provide huge tax breaks to the wealthiest people in this country and to large corporations." Congressional Republicans for years rejected former President Barack Obama's requests for more money for improvements to the nation's roads, bridges, airports and waterways. But Trump has sided with Obama -- and even as his aides insist public-private partnerships and tax credits can be used to fulfill the President's vision, he has pledged to eliminate graft, simplify the tax code and embark on an ambitious infrastructure project. "We will build new roads, and highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and railways all across our wonderful nation," Trump vowed in his inaugural address. Already, however, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, told reporters that Republicans are waiting for the Trump administration -- including McConnell's wife, Elaine Chao, the nominee for transportation secretary -- to present an infrastructure proposal. "My understanding is the administration has a team who are putting together a proposal that we can all take a look at. That includes people both inside the administration and I think the secretary of transportation. And they're going to come up with a proposal. We'll take a look at it," McConnell said. "I hope it will be something credibly paid for," he said. "We have a $21 trillion debt. But I think we would all like to tackle infrastructure in a credible way and hopefully that's what they'll recommend." Schumer and Senate Democrats are hoping to quickly drive a wedge between Trump and Republican lawmakers -- denying them time to figure out how to structure and pay for a major infrastructure bill. The move is aimed squarely at separating Trump's blue-collar supporters from congressional Republicans. "That is something that congressional Democrats have sought for years, but congressional Republicans have stymied us at every turn," Schumer said Tuesday. It comes with Trump already using his executive power and visibility to take concrete steps to impress his Midwestern base -- pulling the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, setting a start for the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement and taking executive action to advance the Keystone XL pipeline. Labor unions, traditionally a key Democratic ally, had long sought those moves -- but Democratic leaders, including former President Barack Obama and 2016 nominee Hillary Clinton, resisted. Labor union leaders also visited Trump in the White House on Monday. Richard Trumka, the president of the AFL-CIO, the powerhouse union that endorsed Clinton, heaped praise on Trump for pulling out of the TPP, calling it "an important first step toward a trade policy that works for working people." Trump's early maneuverings have left Democrats sensing danger -- but also seeing an opening. Trump's moves on trade were criticized by Capitol Hill Republicans. And his calls for a massive infrastructure project have triggered GOP concerns about such a program's price tag. Democrats see the need to exploit that divide quickly: In the 2018 midterm elections, Democratic-held Senate seats are on the ballot in nearly every state in the industrial Midwest, where Trump's popularity with white, working-class voters carried him to the presidency. The party hopes Trump, already unpopular for a new president, will be toxic by the midterms -- with many Democrats pointing to Saturday's women's marches and the higher-than-expected turnout at pro-Obamacare rallies as evidence that the political tide is changing. But as a hedge, Democrats are seeking ways to split GOP lawmakers from Trump -- giving their members ways to accuse Republicans of rejecting popular elements of Trump's platform that Democrats support.

Known as DACA, the program helps undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children get driver's licenses, enroll in colleges and secure jobs. Many expected DACA, which President Obama created with Steve Blando, a spokesman for US Citizenship and Immigration Services, said in a written statement Tuesday that the agency "is still accepting/processing DACA requests under existing policy." Recent comments by Trump and other administration officials have suggested he may take a softer stance when it comes to DREAMers. The administration's priority, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said this week, will be focusing on "those who are in this country illegally and have a record, a criminal record or pose a threat to the American people." Last week Trump told "Fox & Friends" that his plan would be ready in a few months. "It's a plan that's going to be very firm, but it's going to have a lot of heart," he said. Trump also acknowledged this process was "a very tough situation" for people who sought protection under DACA. But, he said, "I think they're going to end up being very happy." Immigrant rights activists have been bracing for changes to the program while Some critics who support a crackdown on illegal immigration are pushing for Trump to act more swiftly, Details on how many DACA applications had been received since Trump's term began on Friday were not immediately available. Statistics on the program are tracked and reported quarterly, Blando said. Since the program began in 2012, about 750,000 applications have been approved. According to It's unclear what would happen to those applications if Trump repeals the program.

He tweeted about the shootings there in early January, saying at the time as President-elect: "If Mayor can't do it he must ask for Federal help." Tuesday night he wrote, "If Chicago doesn't fix the horrible 'carnage' going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016), I will send in the Feds." The Chicago Police Department tells CNN there have been 38 homicides and 182 shooting incidents in the city so far in 2017. Chicago Police only report homicides. They are not necessarily all shooting deaths. Trump has previously encouraged Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel to ask for federal assistance. Asked about Trump's statement following a Chicago city council meeting Wednesday, Emanuel said he "welcomed" the idea of greater federal assistance to address crime in the city. He said federal authorities already play an integral role in fighting crime in the city, referencing the transport of guns across state lines, among other areas. "A lot of the guns, you know, coming into Chicago come from out of state," Emanuel said. "Federal entities are set up to deal with that. And they do. And they work with us. " Mentioning past meetings with Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, Emanuel said he has "been very clear about what we need to do." Previously, Trump voiced strong support for the Second Amendment on the campaign trail, so it's not clear if that's the type of tactic his administration would favor -- Often on the campaign trail, Trump would mention Chicago while suggesting that controversial and possibly unconstitutional tactics such as stop-and-frisk could help address the issue. "A policy like stop-and-frisk could save thousands of lives in a city like Chicago, just like it saved thousands of lives in New York. Overwhelmingly, this will save African-American and Hispanic lives -- citizens who are entitled to the same protections as every American," Trump said during a September rally in Florida.

The move begins a multi-day roll out of immigration actions that's also expected to include moves related to refugees and visas. Trump will make the announcement during a visit to the Department of Homeland Security at 1:25 p.m. ET. Trump himself hinted at Wednesday's move on Twitter, writing "Big day planned on NATIONAL SECURITY tomorrow. Among many other things, we will build the wall!" Trump plans to issue two executive orders Wednesday during his visit to the Department of Homeland Security, according to a person familiar with the President's plan. The first will direct the agency to begin construction of the border wall, as well as take steps to repair existing areas of fencing along the frontier between the US and Mexico. The order will also include a mandate to increase staff at Customs and Border Protection by 5,000 and alleviate the flood of migrants fleeing violence in Central America. According to the person familiar with the plans, Trump's executive order will require DHS to publicly detail what aid is currently directed to Mexico, an indication of an eventual move toward redirecting some of that money to fund the wall's construction - and giving cover for a longstanding campaign promise to have Mexico pay for the structure. A second order will work to eliminate so-called "sanctuary cities," where municipal governments refuse to hand over undocumented immigrants to federal authorities. That order will triple resources for Immigration and Custom Enforcement and direct the federal government to identify criminal aliens in the US. Officials said Trump would wait until later in the week to take action on visas and refugees, potentially as early as Thursday. An order being prepared for Trump's signature includes the drastic measure of suspending the entire refugee program for four months in an attempt to gauge which country's migrants pose the least risk for US national security. A program for admitting Syrian refugees, who are fleeing civil war and a humanitarian crisis, would be ended indefinitely. The measure being drafted specifies that migrants who engage in bigotry, so-called "honor killings" by males of their female relatives, and violence against women shouldn't be admitted. It caps the total number of refugees admitted in the 2017 fiscal year at 50,000. And it directs the Pentagon and US State Department to plan "safe zones" inside Syria, which the previous administration rejected as unlikely to alleviate civilian suffering. But as time went on, Trump's rhetoric on immigration began to change and, at times, soften. His aides eventually walked back the Muslim ban to a ban on immigration from countries with widespread terrorism issues. And while Trump promised to deport all people in the country illegal throughout the campaign, Sean Spicer, his press secretary, said Monday that repealing President Barack Obama's two immigration executive actions were not the President's prime focus. "First and foremost, the President's been very, very clear that we need to direct agencies to focus on those who are in this country illegally and have a record -- a criminal record or poses a threat to the American people," Spicer said. "That's where the priorities going to be." Earlier in January, A US official with knowledge of a visit last month to the Interior Department -- which oversees most federal lands and major environmental laws -- said the transition team was particularly interested in finding out "how long it would take" to build the wall given potential legal obstacles. "It seems clear they were trying to size up the environmental laws that may be obstacles to building the wall," the source said. Another US official told CNN the Trump transition team has also reached out to the Army Corps of Engineers' Southwest Division, that has previously built border security fencing, to determine what previous fencing cost and how it was constructed. The team also asked Interior several questions, including how much wall would be needed, in an effort to determine a solid number of miles of wall necessary to secure the southern border. Trump's announcement comes as a high-level delegation of Mexican leaders arrive in the US for talks. Trump spoke by phone with the Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto on Saturday, and plans to meet with him later this month. The orders on immigration, a congressional aide said, are expected to include restrictions on refugees, and people with some visas from countries including Iraq, Iran, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Somalia and Libya. Retired Marine Corps Gen. John Kelly, Trump's pick to lead the Homeland Security department, was confirmed last week by the Senate. In the first three days of the Trump administration, the US admitted 136 Syrian refugees (Saturday-Monday), according to is State Department Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration. "These executive orders will not make our nation any safer, rather it will make our nation more fearful and less welcoming, and such restrictions run contrary to very founding principles of our nation," Hassan Shibly, executive director of CAIR-Florida told CNN. Shibly said CAIR is already getting calls from US citizens, green card holders, immigrants and even visitors who are concerned about whether they will be allowed to re-enter the US if they leave the country for vacations or travel.

President Donald Trump is showing that he is not forgetting the blue-collar voters who sent him to the White House, making clear during an energetic first full weekday in office that his administration will be devoted to US workers. Flexing his broad executive powers for the first time on the economy, Trump formally withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal that was the centerpiece of the Obama administration's Asia strategy. He also gave notice that he hopes to get a better deal for American workers by renegotiating the North America Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. The President put a bug in the ear of business executives, warning in a meeting they would face huge tariffs if they send manufacturing abroad. And he huddled with union leaders, promising a torrent of new jobs and factories. Tuesday, the "We are going to put a lot of people back to work. We are going to use common sense and we are going to do it the way it is supposed to be done," Trump said Monday. Trump's moves also reversed the bipartisan orthodoxy advanced by successive presidents that has viewed US interests as best served by spreading American-style trade across the globe through large multilateral trade agreements. From now on, Trump said, the US will seek bilateral deals that will most of all benefit Americans and be quickly terminated if US partners cheat. His action quickly scrambled political lines in Washington, as he set himself against large sections of his own Republican Party and consolidated his position on economic territory long occupied by Democrats. Trump's vow to kill or renegotiate multilateral trade deals was an important factor in his narrow November election victories in industrialized states like Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, which upended the political map based on the votes of many workers -- including Democrats -- who feel left behind by economic globalization. Monday's moves offered a first glimpse of the "America First" principle that the President said in his inaugural address on Friday would now undergird every decision on foreign, economic and trade policy. Trump's spokesman Sean Spicer said that Trump was deeply preoccupied with the lives of people who helped him win last November. "I think that's where his head's at, is trying to look at those people that come to his rallies, that have come to his events, that he's met with in person that are struggling and say 'Mr. Trump, I'm working as hard as I can. I'm working two jobs, I'm doing everything by the rules, and I keep getting screwed.'" "That's what he's fighting for," Spicer said. Trump's success in transcending party lines -- at least for now -- was evident in an approving statement about his TPP move from the AFL-CIO, the powerhouse union that endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton for President last year. "Today's announcement that the US is withdrawing from TPP and seeking a reopening of NAFTA is an important first step toward a trade policy that works for working people," said AFL-CIO President Rich Trumka. In a political sense, Trump's busy first weekday in office also put Democrats on the back foot. He used the power and visibility of the presidency to impress his midwestern base of union and blue-collar voters -- even as the demoralized party of ex-President Barack Obama struggles to settle on a message to win them back. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer had only a terse response to Trump's move to pull out of the TPP, a deal the Obama administration spent years trying to negotiate but was unable to get ratified by Congress. "TPP was dead long before President Trump took office. We await real action on trade," said Schumer in a statement. The White House understands it needs a fast start since Trump entered office with the lowest approval ratings for a newly inaugurated president in modern times. Its answer was a swift display of executive power to generate a sense of momentum for his new administration as forthcoming attempts to create jobs through legislation, such as an infrastructure package that many Republicans oppose, could take months. "I am very encouraged by the degree to which they are going to use executive orders to ... dramatically change things very rapidly," said former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump supporter, at a Heritage Foundation lecture. Time and again Monday, reporters were herded into the Oval Office and the Roosevelt Room in the West Wing to see Trump in action, signing executive orders or laying down the law to union leaders or business leaders from blue chip companies like Dell, Ford, Johnson & Johnson and Lockheed Martin. The image of the new President as a man of action was a sign that after a rocky first weekend, which included massive protests nationwide, his off-key speech at the CIA and a new media feud centering around the crowd size at Friday's inauguration, that the new White House was finding its feet and able to drive a coordinated political message. But it's one thing to maintain a solid public relations strategy. It's another to pull off the ambitious reorganizing of US trade and commerce that Trump is proposing. So Monday represented only a small first step. The President's belief that trade pacts are responsible for the flight of many US jobs overseas represents a political risk, since higher tariffs and trade disputes that may result could make foreign goods more expensive for consumers or slow economic growth. Disrupting NAFTA may also be dangerous: Trade between the US, Canada and Mexico hit $1.1 trillion in 2016, according to a Wharton Business School report. Supporters of the pact say it supports millions of jobs in the United States that could be at risk if it falters. Trump's decision to reopen NAFTA therefore represents another significant gamble. For all his claims to being one of the world's great deal makers, the leaders of Canada and Mexico will be under intense political pressure to seal a better deal for their own people in new NAFTA negotiations -- and are unlikely to simply roll over and allow Trump to win all the spoils. Mexico's President Enrique Pexc3xb1a Nieto put Trump on notice Monday for tough negotiations, saying "the Mexican president wants "bilateral relationship with US to translate into more trade and jobs." While Democrats risked being outmaneuvered by Trump on the trade issue -- which played a powerful role in shaping the party's presidential primary, there remain plenty of other areas of contention that suggest the President's honeymoon with unions could be short-lived. The President's labor secretary nominee, Andrew Puzder, for instance opposes calls for a rise in the minimum wage -- an issue that glues Democrats to trade union voters. His administration's business-first mantra could involve efforts to weaken labor protections. And if as expected, Trump chooses a conservative Supreme Court justice, he could rebalance the court in a way that could be damaging to union rights. Trump critics point out that photo-ops and episodes like his claim to have saved jobs at air conditioner firm Carrier during his presidential transition, represent a minuscule step toward creating millions of jobs. And Democrats also Monday accused Trump of hypocrisy for lecturing US corporate bosses on the need to keep manufacturing on US soil. "I'd remind the President of the two simple rules he laid out in his inaugural address -- "Buy American and Hire American" -- two rules that his current businesses do not follow," Schumer said on the Senate floor. "Trump shirts and ties are made in China. Trump furniture is made in Turkey. While he's importuning on others to "make it in America," he should start by demanding it of his own business." There are also geopolitical implications from Trump's decision to pull out of the TPP that could haunt the administration in future. The US withdrawal will certainly benefit an emboldened China and the new administration already appears on collision course with the rising Asian power. US allies like Singapore meanwhile have repeatedly warned US credibility in Asia would be seriously damaged if Washington pulled out of the TPP. The case against Trump's action was spelled out by Republican Sen. John McCain, who is emerging as a fierce critic of the new administration's foreign policy. "This decision will forfeit the opportunity to promote American exports, reduce trade barriers, open new markets, and protect American invention and innovation," McCain said in a statement. "It will create an opening for China to rewrite the economic rules of the road at the expense of American workers. And it will send a troubling signal of American disengagement in the Asia-Pacific region at a time we can least afford it." "It will create an opening for China to rewrite the economic rules of the road at the expense of American workers. And it will send a troubling signal of American disengagement in the Asia-Pacific region at a time we can least afford it." ©The House of Representatives passed legislation Tuesday barring the use of any taxpayer money for abortions, days before a large contingent of anti-abortion activists are scheduled to attend the annual March for Life in Washington. The measure passed mostly along party lines, 238-183. Currently, the so-called "Hyde Amendment," which is regularly attached to annual funding bills, already prohibits federal agencies from using funds for abortion services. The measure approved on Tuesday would make that amendment permanent. The amendment includes an exception for those abortions that are undertaken to protect the life of the mother or done in cases of rape or incest. "Making it (Hyde) permanent is not just important for the moral fiber -- fabric of our country, but you'll see millions more lives saved by us taking this important action," House GOP Whip Steve Scalise, R-Louisiana, told reporters Tuesday. But Democrats said the bill goes far beyond simply codifying an amendment that Congress has routinely tacked onto spending measures since 1976. Opponents insisted that the bill unfairly targets low-income and minority women, and blocks access to reproductive health services, even for those who want to pay for them out of their own pockets. "One of the things that I am just completely sick and tired of is men dictating to women as if we are stupid and cannot make informed choices for ourselves. Women are responsible. Women are smart. Women know what is best for them. And women can make their own choices," California Rep. Linda Sanchez told reporters Tuesday. The legislation also includes a provision that would ban anyone who obtains insurance through health care exchanges created by Obamacare and uses government subsidies from using those funds for plans that cover abortion services. Republicans are working to dismantle the health care law this year. But they decided to make it clear that during any transition period to a new system that Obamacare subsidies would be restricted. Some anti-abortion Democrats that backed Obamacare contend this issue was already addressed when then-President Barack Obama signed an executive order that stated that none of the taxpayer money could be used for abortion services. But anti-abortion groups have said the law isn't clear and there have been multiple legal challenges on how the law has been implemented. The House vote comes one day after President Donald Trump signed an executive order reinstating the so-called "Mexico City" policy. That move bans international non-governmental organizations that perform or promote abortions from receiving any US government funding. "Who the hell are we in this chamber to make these private and often painful decisions for women?" Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern angrily apsked Republicans who backed the measure on the House floor. Throughout debate on the House floor, many House Democrats pointed to the demonstrations in multiple cities across the country on Saturday as evidence that the hundreds of thousands of women who marched emphasized abortion rights as a key issue where the GOP-led Congress was overstepping. But Wyoming GOP Rep. Liz Cheney countered, "We ourselves will be having a very large turnout this week," referring to Friday's March for Life. She also noted that the events on Saturday did not include representation from anti-abortion groups. Senate Republicans have not scheduled a vote on the abortion measure, and leaders say they are focused on confirming the president's cabinet appointments. But if the GOP does move to bring up the bill, a senior Senate Democratic leadership aide told CNN there's "no chance it passes the Senate."

Comey had no intention of resigning, law enforcement officials had previously told CNN after Trump's election. Unlike Cabinet officials, Comey was not expected to depart at the end of former President Barack Obama's tenure. FBI directors have 10-year terms, and Comey's is set to run through 2023. But Comey's unusually public role in the election-season investigation into Hillary Clinton's handling of classified information on her private email server has made him a target of criticism from Democrats, many of whom believe he cost Clinton the election. At a reception for law enforcement officials in the White House on Sunday, Trump greeted Comey with a nod to the FBI director's status. "He's become more famous than me," Trump said with a laugh. In the days after the election, Trump wouldn't commit to keeping Comey when asked by CBS's Lesley Stahl on "60 Minutes." "I think that I would rather not comment on that yet. I don't -- I haven't made up my mind. I respect him a lot. I respect the FBI a lot," Trump said then. He said "there's been a lot of leaking, there's no question," from the FBI. "But I would certainly like to talk to him. And see him. This is a tough time for him. And I would like to talk to him before I'd answer a question like that," Trump said. "I'm not sure. I'd want to see, you know, he may have had very good reasons for doing what he did." Comey has faced intense criticism over his decision to reveal, just days before the November 8 election, that the FBI had discovered new emails on a laptop owned by Anthony Weiner, whose wife, Huma Abedin, was a top Clinton aide, that could have been connected to its investigation. The last-minute bombshell, Democrats believe, halted Clinton's momentum after three strong performances in presidential debates, and with Trump faltering, and sent Republicans who were considering abandoning the party's nominee back into Trump's camp. The Justice Department's internal watchdog announced earlier this month Justice Department Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz said the decision to initiate a review was prompted by requests from numerous members of Congress and public inquiries. Horowitz's office said the review will examine several allegations, including that DOJ or FBI policies were not followed when Comey publicly stated last July that his bureau would not pursue criminal charges against Clinton; that DOJ and FBI employees improperly disclosed non-public information; and that the timing of the FBI's release of certain Freedom of Information Act requests right before the election was improper. Comey is also under the microscope as the FBI The calls were captured by routine US eavesdropping targeting the Russian diplomats, according to the intelligence and law enforcement officials. But the officials said some of the content of the conversation raised enough potential concerns that investigators are still looking into the discussions, amid a broader concern about Russian intelligence-gathering activities in the United States. The officials all stressed that so far there has been no determination of any wrongdoing. FBI and intelligence officials briefed members of the Obama White House team before Obama left office about the Flynn calls to the Russian ambassador, sources said. At a news briefing Monday, Trump press secretary Sean Spicer said he had discussed the issue with Flynn on Sunday. Spicer said there had been two calls between Flynn and the Russian ambassador and that they covered only four subjects: Setting up a call between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin; exchanging holiday greetings; offering condolences for lives lost in a Russian plane crash; and a Syria conference on ISIS.

Instead of focusing on California, Gov. Jerry Brown pointed to the East, warning Washington that the most populous state in the union views the future as "uncertain" after the election, and that "dangers abound." Brown said while federal law may overrule state law on immigration, California would use its enacted protective measures for undocumented immigrants. A variety of state measures offers the undocumented access to higher education and limit the state's cooperation with federal immigration authorities. "We may be called upon to defend those laws and defend them we will," said Brown. "We will defend everybody -- every man, woman and child -- who has come here for a better life and has contributed to the well-being of our state." Brown's promise comes as President Donald Trump has pledged to cut federal funding for so-called sanctuary cities, which could be millions for California's major cities. Underscoring his pledge to protect the undocumented, Brown swore in Xavier Becerra as the state's new attorney general, a former congressman and son of Mexican immigrants. Brown, long an advocate of the environment, also mocked the Trump administration's "alternative facts." The governor pledged the state would forge ahead on its own or with other states and countries on climate change initiatives. "Whatever they do in Washington, they can't change the facts," Brown said. Brown also pledged to protect the five million Californians covered under the Affordable Care Act, but remained vague about how he would make up any gaps should federal funding evaporate. The governor faced a supportive and friendly legislature. California, which is 40% Latino, has a two-thirds Democratic majority in its legislature. The most striking message in Brown's address was its tone. Brown, who had been more restrained in public comments after Trump's election, positioned himself as the leader for the state's progressives, applauding the women's marches across the country last weekend. "This is a time which calls out for courage and for perseverance," said Brown. His last line in his address was a battle cry to his constituents. "California is not turning back. Not now, not ever," he said. "California is not turning back. Not now, not ever," he said. ©Most politicians aren't treated like celebrities. But most politicians aren't Rep. John Lewis. The US congressman, fresh off his feud with President Donald Trump, landed Monday night at Washington's Reagan National Airport, where he was met with a swarm of adoring, selfie-seeking crowds chanting "Thank you!" and "Yes we can!" Lewis, who spent inauguration weekend at home in Atlanta, was one of dozens of Democratic lawmakers who boycotted People at the airport were mystified at first by the ruckus. "We were waiting for our flight to Seattle and kept hearing a roar of applause that was coming in huge waves," said Zach St. John. "He (Lewis) was pretty much immersed in a crowd for the whole time he was in the terminal," St. John told CNN. "He was very nice and shook everyone's hand and took pictures with anyone who wanted it." "We didn't see him say a word," added Elaine Hendrix, the actress and animal rights activist, who was there with a group of friends after attending the Women's March on Washington. "So many people were hugging him, touching him and taking pictures. There were smiles, tears and a great deal of joy." But not everyone was happy to see the congressman. Erika Hubbard, on her way home to Los Angeles after attending Saturday's march, said a few Trump supporters were visibly irritated with all the chanting. "One guy kept yelling, 'No you can't!'" she said. But Lisa Eng-Sarne, who was in town for the march from St. Paul, Minnesota, said Lewis' arrival was a powerful moment. She could hear the cheers continuing as the congressman made his way through the terminal. "It was incredible and inspirational," she said. "I'm glad I was able to see it." "It was incredible and inspirational," she said. "I'm glad I was able to see it." ©South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham blasted President Donald Trump, saying Tuesday he was undermining confidence in both the American democratic system and himself with the continued claims of voter fraud. "I wasn't there, but if the President of the United States is claiming that 3.5 million people voted illegally, that shakes confidence in our democracy - he needs to disclose why he believes that," Graham told CNN on Tuesday. Trump has offered no evidence of the alleged voter fraud, and his claim, originally made two months ago, has been repeatedly debunked. Graham has been one of staunchest Trump critics in the Senate but recently announced he would support Trump's pick for secretary of state, an olive branch to the new President. Graham cautioned Tuesday that the continued harping from Trump would ultimately undermine his own support among the public. "I would urge the President to knock this off; this is the greatest democracy on Earth, we're the leader of the free world, and people are going to start doubting you as a person if you keep making accusations against our electoral system without justification," Graham said. "This is going to erode his ability to govern this country if he does not stop it." Sen. Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican who scrapped with Trump during last year's election, also chastised Trump Tuesday for reviving the issue. "That doesn't do anybody any good. That doesn't help him. That doesn't help any of us," Flake said. Rep. Will Hurd, a Texas Republican, said he saw no evidence of widespread voter fraud. "I would suggest the White House looks in their windshield and not the rearview mirror. They did something that nobody thought they could do. They should be proud (of) that and not let this be a distraction," Hurd told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on "The Situation Room." Graham's candid broadside stood out Tuesday, as other top Republicans -- some apparently exasperated -- ducked questions on Trump's latest comment. Sen. John Thune, R-South Dakota, repeatedly said "I don't know the answer," when asked how Trump came up with his numbers. Sen. Tim Scott, R-South Carolina, would only say "it's not important to me" when asked about Trump's comments. And Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, said Trump's claim was "distracting (journalists,) not me." Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who was at Monday's dinner at the White House when Trump revived the allegation, deflected a question by saying that voter fraud is real and happens in his home state of Kentucky. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, meanwhile, blasted Trump first, and later accused Senate Republicans of not doing enough to deal with the President's wild statements. "The President ought to realize he's president. Instead of talking about the election, or how many people showed up at the inauguration, he ought to talk about how many new jobs he's created. It's time to be president," Schumer said. Schumer then pointed the target at Republicans. "When these falsehoods are told, our Republican colleagues have an obligation to reject them. Not to skirt around them," he said. "The bottom line is simple: you cannot run a government, you cannot help people, you cannot keep America safe if you do not actually admit to the facts." House Speaker Paul Ryan -- who has previously fought back against Trump's allegations of voter fraud -- largely sidestepped a question about his thoughts when Trump brought the claim up again in their m
